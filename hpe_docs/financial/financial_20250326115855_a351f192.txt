PART I
ITEM 1. Business
We are a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, 
analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. We enable customers to accelerate business outcomes 
by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational 
efficiency today and into the future. Our customers range from small-and-medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) to 
large global enterprises and governmental entities. Our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by 
William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our 
dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers.
We use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise Company.
Our Strategy  
Over the last several years, new megatrends around edge, cloud, data, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) have 
emerged to shape customer expectations for enterprise technology. First, data at the edge is increasing 
exponentially, driven by the proliferation of devices that require secure connectivity to enable reliable digital 
experiences. Second, enterprises need a cloud experience everywhere to manage data and workloads wherever 
they live across a distributed enterprise. Third, data growth is creating countless new opportunities to generate 
meaningful business insights. Finally, HPE is seeing an immense demand shift in AI as customers realize the 
fundamental potential of the technology to deliver business transformation. Customer response to these 
megatrends was accelerated by the pandemic and the increasing pace of technological innovation. 
In concert with these trends, enterprises are consuming their technology differently. Increasingly, customers 
want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the 
information technology (“IT”) they use. 
The megatrends are ushering in long-lasting changes to IT, including accelerating hybrid multi-cloud adoption. 
Customers across industry verticals are interested in unifying all the applications and data with a consistent cloud 
experience.
Customers also want to better extract value from their growing stores of rapidly evolving data, knowing that 
actionable insights from data are critical to deliver business transformations. Data is becoming more unstructured, 
more time-sensitive and more distributed. Frequently, data is siloed and spread across different multi-gen IT 
systems, often trapped in critical legacy architecture. Many organizations cannot adequately gain insights from their 
data at the edge or face cloud migration challenges because of their legacy applications. Customers need a data-
first modernization approach across edge to data center to cloud.
HPE has deployed an edge-to-cloud strategy that capitalizes on emergent megatrends and delivers a data-
first modernization approach for customers. Our vision to be the edge-to-cloud company has led us to innovate our 
solutions across connectivity, cloud, and data. We have shifted our mix of products and services, and how we 
deliver that mix to customers. HPE has evolved to a platform-based model, fueled by a portfolio richer in software 
and services. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is a centerpiece of our strategy; it accelerates multi-
generation IT transformation through a unified cloud services experience that empowers customers to access, 
analyze, and extract value from their data across public clouds, data centers, colocation facilities, and at the edge.
Our solutions across connectivity, cloud, and data are delivered as-a-service (“aaS”) through the HPE 
GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform across our Intelligent Edge, Compute, High Performance Computing & Artificial 
Intelligence (“HPC & AI”), and Storage business segments. Financial Services complements our solution offerings 
by helping customers unlock financial capacity.
We recognize the AI market will be driven by computational capability, data-intensive workloads, and the need 
for specialized architecture; thus, we are targeting three areas: supercomputing, AI infrastructure, and AI platform 
software. We believe that we are differentiated from our competition in the ability to capture significant value from 
the growing AI market through our intellectual property portfolio, trusted expertise, and long-term sustained market 
leadership in supercomputing.

Human Capital Resources
At HPE we are united by our purpose, which is to advance the way people live and work. We believe 
technology’s greatest promise lies in its potential for positive change. This is the guidepost for each decision we 
make at HPE. We believe it not only helps guide our contribution to society, but also makes good business sense. 
Our company always strives to be an engine of innovation, and our approximately 62,000 employees as of 
October 31, 2023, are proud of the ways our technology enables our customers to achieve meaningful outcomes 
like curing disease, modernizing farming, addressing world-hunger, and democratizing transportation through 
autonomous vehicles. 
Our Culture - We recognize the critical importance of talent and culture to the success of HPE and our ability 
to fulfill our purpose. We are passionate about the values that drive our success, which is why we believe in 
investing in our team members and in the communities where we live and work. We have identified four key cultural 
beliefs that guide how we lead on a daily basis:  accelerating what’s next, bold moves, the “power of yes we can,” 
and being a force for good. We embed these beliefs in a deep-rooted DNA that puts customers first, enabling us to 
partner, innovate, and act with integrity. HPE has remained committed to its focus on internalizing these values into 
a vibrant culture that creates a superior team member experience and a highly engaged workforce, driving 
improvements across our communications, our reward programs, our talent/performance programs, and our work 
environment. Through such efforts, we aim to foster a collaborative, inclusive, and inspiring experience for all our 
team members and to make HPE a destination for talent while driving high-performance and growth opportunities 
for our team members, and innovation and excellence for our customers. In the midst of the above, we continually 
seek feedback from our team members to better understand and improve their experiences and identify 
opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. Our most recent global engagement survey shows how these 
intentional efforts are making a difference, with an 86% response rate and our overall Employee Engagement Index, 
an index designed to capture team member engagement, measuring 83%. More than 84% of those who responded 
would recommend HPE as a great place to work, and 88% say they are proud to work for HPE.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) - We are committed to creating an unconditionally  inclusive workplace 
and to capturing the ideas and perspectives that advance the way we live and work by enabling our workforce, 
customers, and communities to succeed in the digital age. This is because, by harnessing the potential of our 
technologies and our team members, we can fuel innovation, drive transformational changes, and be a force for 
good. Annual aspirational goals are set to drive consistent representation in the recruiting pipeline in line with 
market availability across all demographics. At the close of fiscal 2023, the representation of worldwide female 
executives in our workforce had increased 1.9 percentage points since the prior year, with increased representation 
at every level in worldwide female team members. We also increased our year-over-year representation of 
underrepresented minorities in the U.S. by 2.3 percentage points overall. We are committed to delivering on our 
focus on equity, as well, by taking a data-led approach at various points across the team member lifecycle to 
evaluate and improve our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The DEI index within our annual global engagement 
survey continued to reveal strong engagement scores across our ethnically diverse team members. The leadership 
standards clearly articulate that all people leaders are expected to continuously develop their inclusive leadership 
acumen. Our Board, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Executive Committee are expected to, and do in fact, 
model high standards for DEI and are leading sustainable change through strong governance and oversight. We 
have also been committed to advancing transparency, by publicly disclosing further information and data on 
diversity, equity, and inclusion at HPE, including the Equal Employment Opportunity report data, since 2018.
Talent - We invest heavily in an effort to attract, develop, and retain the best talent. We are committed to 
developing team members at all stages of their careers, and we do this by communicating a clear purpose and 
strategy; setting transparent goals; driving accountability; continuously assessing, developing, and advancing talent; 
and advancing a leadership-driven talent strategy. The dynamism of our industry and our company enables team 
members to grow in their current roles and build new skills. Over the past year, our approximately 62,000 team 
members completed over 820,700 online and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories – 
leadership; inclusion and diversity; professional skills; technical; and compliance. HPE is deeply committed to 
identifying and developing the next generation of top-tier leadership with a special focus on diverse and technical 
talent. We conduct an in-depth annual talent and succession review with our CEO and Executive Committee 
members. The process focuses on accelerating talent development, strengthening succession pipelines, and 
advancing diversity representation for our most critical roles. 
Pay Equity - We believe people should be paid equitably for what they do and how they do it, regardless of 
their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We maintain policies to promote equal pay, and we regularly 
review our global pay practices with an aim to pay team members in similar roles and locations commensurately 
4


Page 7:
with their experience and responsibilities. We partner with independent third-party experts to conduct annual pay 
assessments and identify unexplained gaps between our present state and our goal of equitable pay treatment for 
all team members. Where these reviews identify such gaps at a country-wide level, we adjust compensation to 
eliminate the gap. As a result of our efforts, our most recent pay equity review demonstrated that we have achieved 
pay parity for base compensation and bonus targets between male and female team members in the U.S. (including 
among underrepresented ethnicities), U.K., and India, when accounting for job title, time-in-role, experience, and 
location. We conduct a number of compensation analyses in other countries to provide competitive and equitable 
pay and, where permissible, we intend to incorporate similar third-party pay assessments into our existing 
processes.
Work That Fits Your Life - This global initiative, which was launched in 2019, is an important example of how 
HPE is investing in our culture and creating a team member experience that aims to make HPE a destination of 
choice for the best talent in the industry. It includes an industry-leading paid parental leave program (minimum 6 
months), part-time work opportunities for new parents or team members transitioning to retirement, and “Wellness 
Fridays” that allows team members a full Friday off four times per year to focus on their well-being. The HPE Global 
Wellness Program is a comprehensive program that promotes overall health and well-being by providing team 
members with programs and resources that offer flexibility built around team member needs while continuing to 
deliver on critical business results. The program consists of four pillars: physical health, financial well-being, mental 
and emotional health, and community well-being. Additionally, we offer a hybrid work environment for the majority of 
our team members, encouraging two days in the office per week for collaboration.
Total Rewards - HPE requires a uniquely talented workforce and is committed to providing total rewards that 
are market-competitive and performance based, designed to drive innovation and operational excellence. Our 
compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance 
that aligns with, and drives stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive 
range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and 
retain key talent.
Board Oversight - Our Board of Directors plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management 
strategy and programs. Our HR and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our human resources and 
workforce management programs, including but not limited to those related to corporate culture; compensation 
plans and policies; diversity and inclusion; and talent acquisition, development, and retention.
HPE’s strong and healthy culture is critical to accelerating what’s next for our customers and partners – and 
the success of our company. We believe that a workforce that is energized and more engaged will fuel our ability to 
pivot and grow, which will, in turn, power the next chapter at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
Our Business Segments, Products and Services 
Our operations are organized into six reportable business segments: Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent 
Edge, Financial Services, and Corporate Investments and Other. The class of similar product categories within each

Data Fabric; OpsRamp which provides a software-as-a-service platform for managed service providers and 
enterprise IT teams to monitor and manage their cloud and on-premises (“hybrid”) infrastructure; and Hewlett 
Packard Labs, which is responsible for research and development.
Segment Realignments
Effective November 1, 2023, in order to align our segment financial reporting more closely with our current 
business structure, we established a new reportable segment, Hybrid Cloud, which includes our historical Storage 
segment, HPE GreenLake Flex Solutions (which provides flexible as-a-service IT infrastructure through the HPE 
GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and was previously reported under Compute and HPC & AI segments), Private 
Cloud, and Software (previously reported under Corporate Investments and Other segment). Additionally, certain 
products and services reported in the financial results for the HPC & AI segment through the end of fiscal 2023 will 
be reported in the Compute and Hybrid Cloud segments, and the recently acquired Athonet business and certain 
components of our CMS business reported in the financial results for Corporate Investments and Other through the 
end of fiscal 2023 will be reported in the Intelligent Edge segment. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we 
will report our results under the realigned six reportable segments.
Our Strengths 
We believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, 
including:

Page 10:
• Edge-to-cloud strategy and solutions uniquely solve customer challenges. As data grows and evolves and 
enterprises become increasingly distributed, HPE’s edge-to-cloud strategy is uniquely designed to enable 
customers to securely access, control, and maximize the value of all their workloads and data assets to 
accelerate business outcomes. The HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is an open, secure, fully 
integrated platform that brings a unified experience across the edge, data center, colocation, and cloud. It is 
automated and easy to consume with capacity available to scale up and down on demand. It offers true pay 
per use consumption so customers only pay for what they use, and they can have the entire hybrid cloud 
experience managed for them through our HPE Managed Services offerings.
• Comprehensive portfolio. We have a distinctive and industry leading portfolio of edge-to-cloud solutions and 
capabilities to help accelerate our customers' digital transformations. We combine our software-defined 
infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise 
solutions in the IT industry. Our ability to deliver a comprehensive IT strategy and connect our customers' 
data from edge to cloud, through our high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services 
in a single package, is one of our principal differentiators.
• Differentiated consumption-based IT solutions for a growing opportunity. Enterprises of all sizes are looking 
to digitally transform in order to develop next-generation cloud-native applications, create actionable 
insights from their data, and drive business growth, but they face many challenges including lack of in-
house IT skills, limited budgets and options for financing, and lack of flexibility to choose the technology 
foundation that best meets their needs. Consumption-based IT offers solutions to these challenges by 
providing greater agility, which empowers people to shift from managing infrastructure to driving innovation 
by leveraging insights from their data, while also eliminating capital and operating expenses tied to 
infrastructure over-provisioning. HPE is distinctly differentiated in delivering a true consumption-based IT 
experience. 
• Open platforms. The world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a 
future of centers of data everywhere, which are highly decentralized and distributed. This shift demands a 
unified cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to customers’ data sources to create 
real-time insights everywhere. We believe the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all 
our customers' clouds, rather than requiring customers to be locked into a cloud stack. 
• Multi-year innovation roadmap and strong balance sheet. We have been in the technology and innovation 
business for over 80 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development 
capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the 
expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments such as cloud, 
artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and cybersecurity to drive business transformations now and in the 
future. We also have a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile that provide the financial flexibility and 
speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.
• Global distribution and partner ecosystem. We are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions to 
our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor, and/or multi-language environments. We have one of 
the largest go-to-market capabilities in our industry, including a large ecosystem of channel partners, which 
enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world. 
Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform provides open cloud application programming interfaces to our 
partners, enabling them to better offer their unique solutions to customers. 
• Custom financial solutions. Through our FS segment, we help customers create investment capacity to 
accelerate their transformations by helping them free up capital, capture value from older assets, achieve 
sustainability goals, invest in new technologies as-a-service, and weather financial volatility. FS is also an 
enabler of our consumption-based IT models by helping spread our upfront solution costs over the duration 
of the customer contract. Through Financial Services' Technology Renewal Centers, we are helping 
customers achieve their own sustainability goals by recovering over 3 million IT assets in fiscal 2022 and 
refurbishing more than 82% for reuse. 
• Experienced leadership team. Our management team has an extensive track record of performance and 
execution. We are led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Antonio Neri, who has proven 
experience in developing transformative business models, building global brands, and driving sustained 
growth and expansion in the technology industry. Mr. Neri's experience includes more than 25 years 
combined at HPE and Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP Co.”) in various leadership positions. Our senior 
management team has many years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of 
and experience in the enterprise IT business and the markets in which we compete.

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 
We manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our 
customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector 
enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly 
through a variety of partners, including:
• resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to 
targeted customer groups;
• distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;
• original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that integrate our products and services with their own products 
and services, and sell the integrated solution;
• independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist 
us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products;
• systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often 
partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and
• advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems 
integration work, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and 
services.
The mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We 
believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales, 
marketing, and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in 
addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. This has 
resulted in a combined go-to-market model, in which we have a direct sales presence in a number of countries, 
while we sell and deliver our products, solutions, and services through a channel-only model in the remaining 
countries. In those countries where we have a direct sales presence, we follow a bifurcated sales operational model 
with separate go-to-market routes for high-velocity, transactional hardware sales, on the one hand and for services 
and solutions, on the other hand. Also, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our 
business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts. The account manager is 
supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers, our businesses 
collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts, both in the commercial 
and public sector space.
Manufacturing and Materials  
We utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture 
products that we design. The use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies 
and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and 
processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our 
brand. In addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number 
of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. 
Historically, we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order 
and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies 
by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units 
to match a customer's particular hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management 
and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize 
inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution 
of products to our customers.
We purchase materials, supplies, and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most 
of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily 
available. However, we do rely on single-source suppliers for certain customized parts (although some of these 
sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption) and a disruption or loss of a single-source 
supplier could delay production of some products. In some instances, our single-source suppliers (e.g., Intel and 
AMD as suppliers of certain x86 processors) are also the single-source suppliers for the entire market; disruptions 
with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately 
disadvantage us relative to our competitors.
9


Page 12:
Like other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a 
combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 
90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain 
components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are 
geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher 
prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin, but does not generally disrupt 
production. We also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints, or enter into longer-term 
pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. See “Risk Factors—We 
depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships 
properly” in Item 1A.
As a result of the pandemic, worldwide demand for electronic components spiked in many different technology 
sectors, causing industry-wide shortages for many electronic components. While availability for many components 
is now recovering, some shortages are nevertheless anticipated to persist, primarily as a result of new demand for 
certain components arising in more diverse sectors without corresponding capacity investments by suppliers to 
meet the new demand. We continue to rely on proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position ourselves 
well for availability of those components. We intend to take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment 
to the market demand, and plan to continue leveraging strong partnerships and long-term agreements with our 
suppliers.
Backlog 
Backlog represents the price of orders related to current or prior periods for which work has not been 
performed or goods have not been delivered as of the reporting period.
The global pandemic resulted in an unprecedented demand for electronic devices, which, coupled with related 
industry-wide supply constraints and inflationary pressures, led to a challenging supply chain environment. 
Additionally, the lasting effects of the pandemic continued to play a role with ongoing delays to the global logistics 
environment. The elevated order book levels we experienced in fiscal 2022 have generally been declining 
throughout fiscal 2023, as supply chain constraints eased (though challenges still remain) and demand softened 
unevenly across our portfolio (as a result of improving supply chain dynamics and as customers have been 
digesting their prior larger orders). Mild improvements to industry-wide supply constraints have helped to ease 
certain supply chain challenges we encountered in the recent past, including the increased availability of supply and 
lower material and logistics costs. Material cost trends are dependent on the strength or weakness of actual end-
user demand and supply dynamics, which will continue to evolve and ultimately impact the translation of the cost 
environment to our pricing actions and, consequently, our operating results. Logistics costs continued to decrease 
from previously elevated levels as a result of declines in both expedited shipments and overall rate costs in the 
freight network.
International 
Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe geographic diversity allows us to meet 
demand on a worldwide basis for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide 
workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic 
trends, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. 
A summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to our 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. Approximately 64% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2023 
came from sales outside the United States.
For a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see “Risk Factors—Due to the 
international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to 
international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial 
condition,” and “Risk Factors—We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” in Item 1A of 
Part I, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” in Item 7A of Part II, and Note 13, “Financial 
Instruments,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

Research and Development 
Innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development efforts 
(“R&D”) are focused on designing and developing products, services, and solutions that anticipate customers' 
changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the 
areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology 
companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences. 
Expenditures for R&D were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2023 and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. We 
anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in the future to support the design and 
development of innovative, high-quality products, services, and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive 
position. 
Included in the R&D work currently taking place at the Company are the following initiatives:
In Compute, we are developing high quality next-generation compute solutions (servers, server attached 
options, and software) that integrate the latest industry technology, which coupled with other innovations from HPE 
are aligned to the requirements of our customers. In the area of software-as-a-service, we are developing cloud-
native, cloud-based server management solutions to complement our existing portfolio.
In HPC & AI, our R&D investments are focused on developing new technology in high-performance 
networking, liquid cooling, artificial intelligence platforms and its application to LLMs, scalable memory systems, and 
high-performance storage and data solutions that underpin our differentiated offerings. We also develop high-
performance computing and artificial intelligence developer tools and software, cloud-native and scalable cluster 
management software, and transaction processing software. These R&D efforts are critical to our competitive 
advantage and enabled our successful delivery of the first exascale supercomputer in the world. HPC & AI also 
collaborates with an applied research group, Hewlett Packard Labs, where we invest in long-term technological 
advancements, including artificial intelligence software, advanced systems architectures, networking, and photonics. 
We also collaborate with government and commercial research institutions and co-invest in many of these areas. 
The work of Hewlett Packard Labs contributes to a pipeline of technologies we consider for future 
commercialization, including quantum computing and its relation to high performance computing. All our products 
are being developed to be delivered in a consumption model, including integration into our HPE GreenLake edge-
to-cloud platform, such as the HPE GreenLake for LLMs offering.
In the Storage and data management domains, we continue to evolve the portfolio to bring the cloud 
operational experience to customers across their hybrid cloud deployment. HPE is focused on helping customers 
simplify how they manage storage and protect their data and workloads on-premises, at the edge, and in the public 
cloud. By leveraging the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform for unified cloud-based management, we have 
transformed the way customers consume and manage storage, while offering robust data protection and private 
cloud solutions. In fiscal 2023, we have expanded our storage portfolio to offer software-defined disaggregated 
storage services that include HPE GreenLake for Block Storage and HPE GreenLake for File Storage. With an 
increased emphasis on simplifying day-to-day management and cloud data protection, HPE GreenLake for Private 
Cloud Business Edition delivers unified virtual machine-to-infrastructure management for both on-premises and 
public cloud environments. With the addition of HPE GreenLake for Disaster Recovery alongside HPE GreenLake 
for Backup and Recovery, customers have access to a complete suite of offerings providing cloud data protection.
In Intelligent Edge, we are investing in a broad portfolio of networking and security capabilities, addressing 
remote-user, branch, campus, data-center, and cloud use-cases. We are expanding our wireless access portfolio to 
include 4G, LTE, and 5G cellular to complement our leadership position in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, with an 
emphasis on hybrid deployments. We have expanded our security investments with the recent acquisition of 
Security Service Edge provider Axis Security and are integrating security with our software-defined wide area 
network (“SD-WAN”) capabilities to deliver a single vendor Secure Access Services Edge solution. Within our 
Ethernet Switch portfolio, we are investing in new Data Center Networking platforms and features to expand our 
total addressable market within our core market. We are leveraging the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to 
provide consistent access to our aaS capabilities and to enable new network-as-a-service business models. We are 
also investing in automation, machine learning, and AI-based network operations to optimize user experience and 
improve operator efficiency, as exemplified by our cloud-native Aruba Central cloud service that provides 
manageability for our entire portfolio, including Wireless LAN, Campus & Data Center Switches, and SD-Branch.
In Hewlett Packard Labs, in addition to the aforementioned HPC & AI-related work, we are focused on 
disruptive innovation and applied research in collaboration with other HPE business groups to deliver differentiated 
11

intellectual property. Our innovation agenda is focused on developing technologies in the areas of system 
architecture, networking, AI, accelerators, quantum computing, silicon photonics, and sustainability. We also 
continue to invest in our silicon design capability to accelerate the development and delivery of our technology.
For a discussion of risks attendant to our R&D activities, see “Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute 
our go-to-market strategy, including our ongoing transition to an aaS consumption-based business model, our 
business, and financial performance may suffer” in Item 1A.
Patents 
Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products 
and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. As of October 31, 
2023, our worldwide patent portfolio included approximately 13,000 issued and pending patents.
Patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been 
built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our 
patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and 
services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to 
participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself 
essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments.
In addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem 
appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when 
we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-
licenses with third parties.
For a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see “Risk Factors—Our financial performance 
may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our 
businesses depend” and “—Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology 
licensed from third parties” in Item 1A. 
Seasonality
From time to time, the markets in which we sell our products, services, and solutions experience weak 
economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our 
products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months. See “Risk Factors—
Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future 
financial results less predictable” in Item 1A.
Competition
We have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products, solutions, and services which 
includes our as-a-service offerings. We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We compete 
primarily on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, 
range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and 
support, security, and the availability of our IT infrastructure offerings.
The markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with 
long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are 
relatively short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, continuously enhance our 
existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among others. In 
addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture, 
and market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner 
relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices 
on many of our products and services to stay competitive.
The competitive environments in which our segments operate are described below:
Compute and Storage businesses operate in the highly competitive enterprise data center infrastructure 
market, which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition. Our primary 
competitors are technology vendors, such as Dell Technologies Inc., Super Micro Computer, Inc., Cisco Systems, 
Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), and NetApp Inc. In certain regions, 
we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or “white-box” manufacturers.

deliver performance scalability and connectivity necessary to handle super-compute and AI workloads, including 
Dell Technologies Inc., Super Micro Computer, Inc,, Lenovo Group Ltd., IBM, Fujitsu Network Communications, Inc., 
and Atos Information Technology Incorporated. In our software platform for AI model development and deployment, 
we both compete and cooperate with cloud service providers and start-up companies that deliver platforms for AI 
model training, tuning, and inferencing.  Similar to the compute space, our strategy is to deliver superior products, 
high-value technology support services, and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, 
software, and services capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our deep expertise and capabilities 
designing and delivering these solutions, broad end-to-end heterogeneous and open solutions portfolio, supported 
by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global

networking components and software, high-value technology support services, and differentiated integrated 
solutions that combine our infrastructure, software, and services capabilities. Our competitive advantage includes 
our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and 
development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.
Financial Services. In our financing business, our primary competitors are captive financing companies, such 
as IBM Global Financing, Dell Financial Services, and Cisco Capital, as well as banks and other financial 
institutions. Our primary IT Asset Disposition (“ITAD”) competitors are ERI, Ingram Micro, Sage Sustainable 
Electronics, and Sims Recycling Solutions. We believe our competitive advantage over banks, other financial 
institutions, and ITAD providers is our ability to bring together our investment solutions with our expertise in 
managing technology assets. Not only are we able to deliver investment solutions that help customers create 
unique technology deployments based on specific business needs, but we also help them extract value from 
existing IT investments while more efficiently managing the retirement of those assets. All of these solutions can 
help customers accelerate digital transformation, create new budget streams, and meet Circular Economy 
objectives. 
For a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see “Risk Factors—We operate 
in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance” 
in Item 1A.
Environmental Sustainability 
Living Progress - Living Progress is our business strategy for creating sustainable IT solutions that meet the 
technology demands of the future, while advancing the way people live and work. This strategy underpins our 
commitment to the environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors most important to stakeholders. Our 
edge-to-cloud strategy helps our customers transform and digitize their business while reducing the environmental 
footprint of HPE and our customers. A legacy of ESG leadership increases our competitiveness and differentiates us 
in the marketplace by helping our customers achieve not only their business objectives, but also their sustainability 
goals. The HPE Board of Directors, including through its committees, provides oversight of our ESG strategy, risks, 
practices, policies, and disclosures, to support integration with our core business strategy. 
Sustainable Value Creation - Sustainability performance is a core business discipline within HPE. Our Living 
Progress strategy and sustainability programs are key to our lasting relationships with our customers, and our 
sustainability credentials provide us with a competitive advantage in the market, support talent acquisition and 
retention, and enable ongoing access to global markets.
HPE has committed to becoming a net-zero enterprise by 2040, with intermediate targets set across our value 
chain for 2030. These climate targets are approved by the Science Based Target initiative and align with the latest 
climate science. Our commitment is supported by our Net-Zero Roadmap, which defines the levers we plan to 
13


Page 16:
prioritize to enable us to deliver on our near- and long-term carbon emissions reduction targets and outlines key 
assumptions with respect to our reduction targets.
In 2023, the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) resulted from our customers' use of our 
products and solutions. We recognize the opportunity to innovate technologies for a carbon-constrained world and 
are committed to delivering products and services that empower our customers to reduce the carbon footprints of 
their IT estates while also gaining maximum productivity from their IT investments and reducing costs. For instance, 
in 2023, HPE launched a portfolio of new and enhanced sustainable IT services to enable IT to run more 
sustainably from the data center to the workload. 
To enable market access across the globe and aid customers in selecting more sustainable IT solutions, many 
of our products are certified by eco-labels such as Electronic Product Environment Assessment Tool, TCO Certified, 
Energy STAR, China SEPA and the China Energy Conservation Program. 
Supply Chain Responsibility and Human Rights 
We manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social 
goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for our customers, partners, and suppliers. Building 
upon the successful launch of our supply chain data management software, we have granted access to suppliers 
representing 80% by production spend to visualize their company-specific emissions data and the ability to track 
progress toward their publicly stated emissions reduction goals. In 2023, we participated in the Responsible 
Business Alliance pilot of an Environmental Management Tool (“EMT”) to request primary GHG emissions data from 
a small number of our suppliers using third-party software. The EMT enables all suppliers to disclose their GHG 
emissions, reduction targets, and reporting and verification statuses to their customers in a consolidated, industry-
standard survey, increasing ESG transparency, maturity, and data availability.
We are conscious of the importance of the responsible use of our products. In an effort to prevent intended 
and unintended harm, we continue to consider who purchases our offerings and how they are used by, among other 
things, limiting features, including responsible use clauses, monitoring for risk of alternate end uses, and promoting 
deployment of AI with safeguards, such as user training and ongoing checks and refinement to mitigate bias and 
improve accuracy.
Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion extends beyond our workforce and to our suppliers, as well. 
We believe a diverse supply chain and equity in sourcing not only creates opportunities for underrepresented and 
underserved communities, but also contributes to the resiliency of our supply chain and of our communities.
Human rights principles are embedded in how we do business, and we are committed to holding our entire 
value chain to high ethical standards that respect such principles. We have processes in place to enable the early 
detection of forced labor and have implemented due diligence procedures to monitor and help prevent human rights 
violations or abuses at our suppliers and in our operations. Additionally, through our Responsible Minerals Program, 
we work to advance the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products and within our supply chain.
We are also committed to the responsible and ethical development and deployment of new technologies to 
advance how we live and work, and we continue to build on our existing responsible development work, particularly 
in relation to AI. We have an executive level AI Ethics Responsibility Committee and an operational AI Ethics 
Working Group, through which we aim to align the development, deployment, and use of AI with HPE's AI Ethical 
Principles, promoting privacy-enabled and secure, human focused, inclusive, robust, and responsible use of AI.
In 2022, we refined our approach to assessing ethical AI and rolled out AI Ethical Principles training. In 2023, 
we further advanced this initiative by launching three new sub-committees to help us operationalize our principles 
for: Products (AI we develop), Processes (AI we source to use), and Partnerships (AI we source to incorporate into 
our solutions).
While the HPE Board of Directors and all of its committees take an integrated, rather than siloed, approach to 
providing oversight of ESG matters, including environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, and human 
rights, our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee is primarily responsible for oversight of 
our broader ESG strategy, initiatives, risks, policies, and disclosures.
Material Government Regulations 
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products and 
services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these 
governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and 
14


Page 17:
competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our 
operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of 
operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government 
regulations. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that global trade and certain environmental regulations 
could potentially materially impact our business.
Environment 
Our products and operations are, or may in the future be, subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign 
laws and regulations concerning the environment, including, among others, laws addressing the discharge of 
pollutants into the air and water; supply chain due diligence, and sustainability, environment and emissions-related 
reporting; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of 
contaminated sites; product compliance and safety, such as repairability, chemical composition, packaging and 
labeling; energy consumption of our products and services; and the manufacture and distribution of chemical 
substances. We proactively evaluate, and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into 
account, among other things, published lists of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, 
customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment.  
We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, 
including servers and networking equipment, subject to certain repairability requirements or financially responsible 
for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred 
to as “product take-back legislation”). We are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to 
sustainability issues such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, reusing or recycling. Finally, as climate 
change and other environmental-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are adopted 
and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or 
other sanctions, including fines. In the event our products are impacted by these laws or standards, our products 
could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private 
companies, and we could face other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be 
fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are 
collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be 
used to address climate change and other environmental-related issues, and to facilitate compliance with related 
laws, regulations and treaties. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental and 
environmental-related laws applicable to our operations, products and services, and to reducing our environmental 
impact across all aspects of our business. We support this commitment with a range of comprehensive policies, 
including relating to environmental, health and safety, climate, water, and electronic waste; a strict environmental 
management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services; an extensive supply chain 
responsibility program; and an approach to ethical standards and strong governance that are the foundations of our 
business.
Global Trade 
As a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations 
including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules 
around the world. Such laws, rules, and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact 
our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and 
individuals, or the need to comply with domestic preference programs, laws concerning transfer and disclosure of 
sensitive or controlled technology or source code, unique technical standards, localization mandates, and 
duplicative in-country testing and inspection requirements. The consequences of any failure to comply with 
domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally. We continue to support 
open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated cross-border supply chains that will continue to 
contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to 
ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.
You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise and its common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our 
results of operations or financial condition. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 
7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” and the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 
Form 10-K.
Business and Operational Risks 
If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, including our ongoing transition to an aaS 
consumption-based business model, our business, operating results, and financial performance may 
suffer. 
Our long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware, software, and services as we 
deliver global edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from 
all of their data, everywhere. We continue our transition to an aaS company, to provide our entire portfolio through a 
range of subscription and consumption-based, pay-per-use, and aaS offerings. We will also continue to provide our 
hardware and software in a capital expenditure and license-based model, giving our customers choices in 
consuming HPE products and services. To successfully execute this strategy and transition, we must continue to 
improve cost structure, align sales coverage with strategic goals, improve channel execution and strengthen our 
capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our 
strategic capabilities in areas such as edge computing, hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, data center networking, 
network security and high-performance compute. We must make sufficient long-term investments in strategic growth 
areas, such as developing, obtaining, and protecting appropriate intellectual property and committing significant 
R&D and other resources before knowing whether our projections will reasonably reflect customer demand for our 
solutions. Should such efforts fail to produce actionable insights, or our offerings not perform as designed or 
promised, we may be unable to manage or complete the transition successfully or in a timely manner, not realize all 
of the anticipated benefits of the transition (even if we complete it), and our business results and financial condition 
may be adversely affected.  Furthermore, such incremental capital requirements may negatively impact cash flows 
in the near term, and may require us to dedicate additional resources, including sales and marketing costs.
The process of improving our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform’s aaS solutions and enhancing existing 
hardware, software, and cloud-based solutions is complex, costly, and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate 
customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately, to invest sufficiently in strategic growth 
areas, or to otherwise successfully execute this strategy could significantly harm our market share, results of 
operations, and financial performance. Having developed a cloud platform product in HPE GreenLake, we must be 
able to continue to scale quickly, while also managing costs and preserving margins, which means accurately 
forecasting volumes, mixes of products, and configurations that meet customer requirements, which we may not 
succeed at doing. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform faces competition from peer companies with their 
own cloud platform offerings, and any delay in the development, production, or marketing of a new product, service 
or solution, including new features of the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, could result in our offerings being 
late to reach the market, which could further harm our competitive position. Furthermore, we anticipate needing to 
continually adapt our go-to-market structure with new sales and marketing approaches, to better align with the 
software consumption-based business model. Changing our go-to-market structure may affect employee 
compensation models and ultimately our ability to retain employees. There is no assurance that we will be able to 
successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that we will be able to realize all 
or any of the expected benefits from them.
These solutions generally are multiyear agreements, which result in recurring revenue streams over the term 
of the arrangement. As customer demand for our software consumption-based offerings increases, we will 
experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings (for which revenue is 
generally recognized at the time of delivery) and our aaS offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized 
ratably over the term of the arrangement). As such, our financial results and growth depend, in part, on customers 
continuing to purchase our services and solutions over the contract life on the agreed terms. Additionally, transition 
to this business model also means that our historical results, especially those from before the transition, may not be 
indicative of future results, which may adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results. 
Further, these contracts allow customers to take actions, such as requesting rate reductions, reducing the use of our 
services and solutions or terminating a contract early, which may adversely affect our recurring revenue and 
profitability. Further, our software consumption offerings could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the 
provision of services as well as operational, technical, legal or other costs. 
19


Page 22:
We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier 
relationships properly. 
Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products, and services, as well 
as our suppliers’ abilities to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products, and services at reasonable 
prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. Given the wide 
variety of solutions that we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and 
the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble, and deliver certain solutions, problems have, from time to 
time in the past, arisen, and could in the future arise, in production, planning, and inventory management that could 
harm our business. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply 
disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of 
our suppliers have at times decided, and may in the future decide, to discontinue conducting business with us. 
Other supplier problems that we have faced, and could again face in the future, include component shortages, 
excess supply, and contractual, relational, and labor risks, each of which is described below. 
• Component shortages. We have been experiencing delays and shortages of certain components as a result 
of strong demand and capacity constraints caused by insufficient capacity to meet unanticipated demand from 
emerging markets, and other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to 
new suppliers. Though we have seen easing of industry-wide supply constraints, we expect discreet 
constraints to continue, the duration of which remains uncertain. In the past, we have experienced shortages 
or delays, which led to higher prices of certain components and exposure to quality issues and delivery 
delays, which may occur again in the future. We may not be able to secure enough components at 
reasonable prices, of acceptable quality, or at all, to build products or provide services in a timely manner in 
the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business and financial performance 
could suffer from a loss of time-sensitive sales, additional freight costs incurred, or the inability to pass on 
price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we may have to reengineer 
some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays. 
• Excess supply. In order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make advance 
payments to suppliers or enter into long term agreements, non-cancellable commitments, or other inventory 
management arrangements with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance 
of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future 
components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess 
or obsolete components, which has at times adversely impacted and could in the future adversely impact our 
business and financial performance. 
• Contractual terms. As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be 
obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current 
market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing 
components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to 
competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and 
we could incur charges relating to inventory obsolescence. 
• Contingent workers. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our 
failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We 
have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could 
face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms 
relating to contingent workers. Our ability to manage the size and cost of our contingent workforce may be 
subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws. 
• Single-source suppliers. We obtain certain components from single-source suppliers due to technology, 
availability, price, quality, scale, or customization needs. Certain of such suppliers have, in the past decided, 
and may in the future decide, to discontinue manufacturing components used in our products, which may 
cause us to discontinue certain products, incur additional costs to redesign our products so as not to 
incorporate such discontinued components, or incur time and expense to find replacement suppliers. 
Replacing a single-source supplier has at times delayed, and could delay, production of some products as 
replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations. For 
some components, such as customized components, alternative sources either may not exist or may be 
unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In 
addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that 
contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier 
with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers under those 
20


Page 23:
agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, 
quantity, and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our 
relationship with a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which 
we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial 
performance. 
System security risks, data protection incidents, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt 
our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our 
revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our stock price. 
As a leading technology firm, we are exposed to attacks from criminals, nation state actors, malicious 
insiders, and activist hackers (collectively, “malicious parties”) who have at times been able to circumvent or bypass 
our cyber security measures. Although some of these attacks have caused disruptions or exposure of information, 
so far, these attacks have not resulted in material impacts to HPE, nor have any of HPE’s consumers, customers, or 
employees informed HPE that these attacks resulted in material harm to them. It is possible that future attacks may 
result in material misappropriation, system disruptions or shutdowns, malicious alteration, or destruction of our 
confidential or personal information or that of third parties. Further, there has been an increase in the frequency and 
sophistication of such attacks, and we expect these activities to continue to increase. Malicious parties also may be 
able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, and other malicious software programs that attack our 
products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, including within our cloud-based 
environments and offerings. Further, cyber-attacks or incidents have in the past gone, and could in the future go, 
undetected in our environments for a period of time. Given our broad and diverse network environment, resource 
limitations, and operational constraints, we have in the past failed, and may in the future fail, to patch certain 
security vulnerabilities in time to prevent successful disruptions of our infrastructure or expose information. 
Malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain and the systems or networks of other third 
parties on whom we rely, and as such, may embed malicious software or hardware in our products, thereby 
compromising our customers. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and 
Ukraine or Israel and Hamas, may create a heightened risk of such cyberattacks or exacerbate system 
vulnerabilities, considering our continued hybrid work environment. In addition, sophisticated hardware and 
operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in 
design or manufacture, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs 
associated with cybersecurity tools and infrastructure and fierce competition for scarce cybersecurity and IT talent 
have at times limited, and may in the future limit, our ability to efficiently identify, eliminate, or remediate cyber or 
other security vulnerabilities or problems or enact changes to minimize the attack surface of our network. 
Furthermore, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, 
cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, 
distribution or other critical functions. Additional impacts from cybersecurity incidents could include remediation 
costs to our customers, suppliers, or distributors, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system 
damage, and incentives for continued business; lost revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary 
information or the failure to retain or attract business partners following an incident; increased insurance premiums; 
and damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value.  
We manage and store various proprietary information, intellectual property, and sensitive or confidential data 
relating to our business. In addition, our business may process, store, and transmit customer data, including 
commercially sensitive and personal data, subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation, the 
California Consumer Privacy Act, and other privacy laws and regulations related to the handling of personal data. 
With our business increasingly providing aaS offerings, malicious parties could target such services, potentially 
resulting in an increased risk of compromise of customer data and regulatory exposure. Incidents involving our 
cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of 
proprietary information, intellectual property, or sensitive, confidential, or personal data about us, our clients, or our 
customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of 
deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information; 
result in regulatory fines, litigation, and potential liability for us; damage our brand and reputation; or otherwise harm 
our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other IT solutions or incur significant 
expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our 
products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of managing an incident and 
implementing further data protection measures could be significant. 
Additionally, we have at times experienced, and may experience, other security issues that are not results of 
any action or attack from malicious parties, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors 
or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. Portions of our IT infrastructure also have experienced, and may 
21


Page 24:
experience, interruptions, delays, or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration 
or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and 
transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive, and 
resource intensive. Furthermore, our data centers depend on predictable and reliable energy and networking 
capabilities, the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected or disrupted by a variety of factors, including 
but not limited to the effects of climate change. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders 
and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins, or lost customers 
resulting from these events could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our reputation 
and stock price. 
While we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our products, services, IT systems, controls, and 
software that could be exploited by any malicious parties, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we 
have at times failed, and may fail, to anticipate, detect, identify, and/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are 
exploited. There is no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material in the aggregate at a 
future date even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. 
Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our 
costs and expenses.  
Our worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or human-induced disasters 
including, but not limited to, earthquakes; tsunamis; floods; hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons; fires; other extreme 
weather conditions; power or water shortages; telecommunications failures; materials scarcity and price volatility; 
terrorist acts, civil unrest, conflicts or wars; and health epidemics or pandemics. The impacts and frequency of any 
of the above could be further exacerbated by climate change, particularly in countries where we operate that have 
limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources. While we are predominantly self-insured to mitigate the 
impact of most catastrophic events, the occurrence of business disruptions could, among other impacts, harm our 
revenue, profitability, and financial condition; adversely affect our competitive position; increase our costs and 
expenses; make it difficult or impossible to provide our offerings to our customers or to receive components from our 
suppliers; create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain; or require substantial expenditures and recovery time 
in order to fully resume operations. 
Public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures taken in response to such events 
have in the past negatively impacted, and may again in the future negatively impact, our operations and workforce, 
as well as those of our partners, customers and suppliers. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of such 
events have, from time to time, caused increased volatility in financial and other capital markets, adversely 
impacting our stock price, our ability to access the capital markets, and our ability to fund liquidity needs, and may 
do so again in the future. The negative impacts of any such events on business operations and demand for our 
offerings will depend on future developments and actions taken in response to such events, which may be outside 
our control, highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time. 
The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are 
concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the United States, Puerto Rico, Czech Republic, Mexico, 
China, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore. We also rely on major logistics hubs, which are strategically 
located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to HPE’s distribution channels and 
customers. Other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near 
major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, 
logistics, or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including those enumerated above, as 
they have been in the past by natural disasters and public health issues in the United States, Puerto Rico, and 
China.  To the extent such disruptions adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and 
stock price, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item 1A of Part I of 
this Form 10-K. 
Any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations, divestitures 
and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects. 
As part of our strategy, we may acquire businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances 
and joint ventures, and make investments to further our business (collectively, “business combination and 
investment transactions”), and also handle any post-closing issues, such as integration. For example, among other 
acquisitions and subsequent integrations, in June 2023, we acquired Athonet, a private cellular network technology 
provider, in May 2023, we acquired OpsRamp, Inc., an IT operations management company, in March 2023, we 
acquired Axis Security, a cloud security provider, in September 2020, we acquired Silver Peak Systems, Inc., an 
SD-WAN industry leader and in September 2019, we acquired Cray  Inc., a global supercomputer leader. In April 
22


Page 25:
2017 and September 2017, we spun off our Enterprise Services and Software businesses, respectively. See also 
the risk factors below under the heading “Risks Related to Prior Separations.” 
Risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which 
could adversely affect our financial results, including our effective tax rate: 
• We may not successfully combine product or service offerings or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of 
any particular business combination and investment transaction, which may result in (1) failure to retain 
employees, customers, distributors, and suppliers; (2) increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet 
contractual obligations which may cause financial results to differ from expectations; and (3) significant 
increase in costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee 
benefit costs, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, 
assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to 
executive officers and key employees under retention plans. 
• Our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and 
our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of 
statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives. We may fail to 
identify significant issues with the acquired company’s product quality, financial disclosures, accounting 
practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs, 
timing and other matters. 
• In order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, 
potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements, which 
could affect our liquidity and financial condition. 
• For an acquisition or other combination, the acquisition partner may have differing or inadequate 
cybersecurity and data protection controls, which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and 
potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business. 
• Business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial 
condition and results of operations. 
• We have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of 
certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and, to the 
extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and 
investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to 
the impairment of those assets. 
• For a divestiture, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable 
terms in a timely manner, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than 
we had anticipated. 
• The impact of divestitures on our revenue growth may be larger than projected, as we may experience 
greater dis-synergies than expected. If we do not satisfy pre-closing conditions and necessary regulatory and 
governmental approvals on acceptable terms, it may prevent us from completing the transaction. Dispositions 
may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity 
ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by 
the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results. 
• Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise if our Board of Directors deems it to be undesirable. Provisions such as indemnification, 
meeting requirements, and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy 
contests, or changes in control or management of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 
Management’s attention or other resources may be diverted during business combination and investment 
transactions and further impacted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and 
investment transactions that further our strategic objectives. 
If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial 
performance could suffer. 
We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including both 
direct and indirect sales to end-users. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel 
efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, 
since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous 
23


Page 26:
balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 
and therefore our profitability. 
Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the 
financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by 
any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or 
distribution arrangement. Moreover, some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources 
and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry 
consolidation, and market trends. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit 
insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we 
could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors’ financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the 
credit markets or operations weaken. 
Our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through 
distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to 
distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors have in the past adjusted orders 
during periods of product shortages, and may do so in the future, in addition to cancelling orders if their inventory is 
too high or delaying orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to 
the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our 
reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and 
therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our 
prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or 
ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes. We also may have limited ability to 
estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively. 
In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition key employees, 
and failure to do so could seriously harm us. 
In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition qualified executives 
and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing, and IT support 
positions. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must 
provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. These are 
particularly important considering our recent segment realignment, as we shift our growth strategy to capture the 
market opportunity presented by hybrid cloud. Certain equity-based incentive awards for certain executives contain 
conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future 
value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive awards does not 
materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total 
compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed 
to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, 
retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. 
Our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key 
employees could have a significant impact on our operations and our ability to execute our strategy. Further, 
changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and 
assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As 
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry has grown increasingly intense, we have experienced, and 
may in the future experience, higher than anticipated levels of employee attrition, which has resulted in increased 
costs to hire new employees with the desired skills and may do so again in the future. In addition, significant or 
prolonged turnover or revised hiring priorities may negatively impact our operations and culture, as well as our 
ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, and 
other expertise.  These risks to attracting and retaining the necessary talent may be exacerbated by recent labor 
constraints and inflationary pressures on employee wages and benefits. 
Failure to meet ESG expectations or standards or achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our 
business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. 
There has been an increased focus from regulators and stakeholders on ESG matters. Given our commitment 
to ESG, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, 
commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, 
and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations, are based on available data and estimates, and are not 
guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on 
expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently 
be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Initiatives to address such ESG issues may be 
24


Page 27:
costly and may not have the desired effect. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to manage 
these issues and accomplish our goals, commitments, and targets present numerous operational, regulatory, 
reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which may be outside of our control or could have adverse 
impacts on our business, including on our stock price. Further, there is uncertainty around the accounting standards 
and climate-related disclosures associated with emerging laws and reporting requirements and the related costs to 
comply with the emerging regulations. 
Our failure or perceived failure to achieve our ESG goals, maintain ESG practices, or comply with emerging 
ESG regulations that meet evolving regulatory or stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation, adversely 
impact our ability to attract and retain customers and talent, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the 
investment community and enforcement authorities. Our reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that our 
stakeholders have about our action or inaction on certain ESG-related issues, or because they may disagree with 
our goals and initiatives. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products 
and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial performance, as well as require additional 
resources to rebuild our reputation. 
Issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm or liability. 
We currently incorporate AI capabilities into certain of our offerings, and our research into and continued 
development of such capabilities remain ongoing. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, challenges, and 
unintended consequences that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms and training 
methodologies may be flawed. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us or others 
could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. These 
deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, 
and brand or reputational harm. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on 
human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience competitive, 
brand, or reputational harm or legal and/or regulatory action. Further, incorporating AI gives rise to litigation risk and 
risk of non-compliance and unknown cost of compliance, as AI is an emerging technology for which the legal and 
regulatory landscape is not fully developed (including potential liability for breaching intellectual property or privacy 
rights or laws). While new AI initiatives, laws, and regulations are emerging and evolving, what they ultimately will 
look like remains uncertain, and our obligation to comply with them could entail significant costs, negatively affect 
our business, or entirely limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings.
Additionally, leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve internal functions and operations presents further 
risks and challenges. While we aim to use AI ethically and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical or legal issues 
presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. The use of AI to 
support business operations carries inherent risks related to data privacy and security, such as intended, 
unintended, or inadvertent transmission of proprietary or sensitive information, as well as challenges related to 
implementing and maintaining AI tools, such as developing and maintaining appropriate datasets for such support. 
Further, dependence on AI without adequate safeguards to make certain business decisions may introduce 
additional operational vulnerabilities by impacting our relationships with customers, partners, and suppliers; by 
producing inaccurate outcomes based on flaws in the underlying data; or other unintended results. 
Risks arising from climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy may impact our business 
Climate change serves as a risk multiplier that could increase both the frequency and severity of natural 
disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations and those of suppliers and customers. Our corporate 
headquarters is located in Spring, Texas, which suffers from floods, hurricanes, and other extreme weather, and a 
portion of our research and development activities are located in California, which suffers from drought conditions 
and catastrophic wildfires, each affecting the health and safety of our employees. In California, to mitigate wildfire 
risk, electric utilities have, at times periodically deployed, and may in the future, periodically deploy public safety 
power shutoffs, which affect electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities. Certain sites located in the 
United States, Middle East, China, and India experience exposure to extreme heat and water stress, which could 
potentially jeopardize the health and well-being of our employees, consequently impacting our operations. While we 
seek to mitigate the business risks associated with climate change through site selection, infrastructure 
technological investments and robust environmental programs, this may require us to incur substantial costs, and 
we may be unsuccessful in doing so as there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. 
Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative 
impacts of natural disasters by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters. 
The increasing concern over climate change could also result in transition risks, such as shifting customer 
preferences or compliance risks from changing regulatory and legal requirements. Changing customer preferences 
may result in increased demands for sustainable solutions, products, and services, which may cause us to incur 
25


Page 28:
additional costs, invest more in R&D, or make other changes to other operations to respond to such demands, 
which could adversely affect our financial results. We may also confront higher electricity prices as the grid 
decarbonizes, and higher costs for supplies or components that comply with certain environmental regulatory 
thresholds, potentially impacting our margins or the pricing of our offerings. If we fail to manage these and other 
transition risks in an effective manner, customer demand for our solutions, products, and services could diminish, 
and our profitability could suffer. 
If we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business, and financial 
performance may suffer. 
In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our 
products, services, and solutions, including defects in our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes and 
unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our 
products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their 
employees. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in 
product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, 
the products, services, and solutions that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts 
may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty 
components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or 
offer a temporary fix (or “patch”) to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, 
which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue, 
cash flows, and profitability. In addition, after products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or 
replace such products. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, 
replacement, and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. If new or existing customers have 
difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions, our results of operations could be 
adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, 
quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and 
reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
Industry Risks 
We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and 
financial performance. 
Our ability to implement solutions for our customers, anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes 
in technology (such as cloud-, AI-, and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving), and develop new 
service offerings or incorporate technological improvements into our offerings that meet current and prospective 
customers’ needs, as well as evolving industry standards, is critical to our competitiveness and success. We 
encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our 
competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete primarily 
on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, 
portfolio of products, ease of use, account relationships, customer training, service and support, and security of our 
offerings. If our products, services, support, and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on 
any of those criteria, our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed. 
We have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial, personnel, and other 
resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or 
specialize in one or more of our product or service lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our 
business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and marketing 
resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against 
theirs. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies, successfully adapt to industry developments and 
changing demand, and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the 
demands of the markets we serve, we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and 
execute on our growth strategy, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial 
condition. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous, and potentially 
stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our competitors may affect our business by 
entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers. 
Companies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in 
other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships 
with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these 
complicated relationships with vertical partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
26


Page 29:
We face aggressive price competition and may continue to do so. As a consequence of inflation and higher 
supply chain and manufacturing costs, we have in the past increased the prices of many of our products and 
services to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin, and may do so again in the future. In addition, 
competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can 
obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and 
components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash 
flows, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide 
pricing pressures. 
Because our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products and services, we 
may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on R&D than some of our competitors. If we cannot 
proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from R&D expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive 
price pressures, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our 
offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose 
market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects. 
Even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance 
could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is 
becoming obsolete. For example, our Storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition 
towards software defined and public cloud, which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage 
products. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products. 
International Risks 
Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory 
regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and 
expenses, and financial condition. 
Our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the 
demand for technology hardware, software, and services in, and continued access to, the markets in which we 
compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty and constrained spending on network and enterprise infrastructure 
have in the past adversely affected the demand for our products, services, and solutions. These have resulted in 
increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment 
charges, and made it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross 
margin, cash flows, and expenses, and may have such effects again in the future. Such factors, including how long 
such conditions may persist, among others, may negatively impact the evenness or volume of demand for our 
products and services, potentially resulting in impacts similar to those mentioned above, though the precise extent 
of such impacts cannot be accurately predicted. 
Economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any 
financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, or any significant financial services institution 
failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate 
rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. Interest and other expenses have varied, and 
could continue to vary, materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, 
currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. For example, in 
response to increasing inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with central banks around the world, have been 
raising interest rates, signaled expectations of additional rate increases, and have indicated these rates may remain 
higher for longer. It is difficult to predict the impact of such events on us, our third-party partners, our customers, or 
economic markets more broadly, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of 
governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Such 
actions have impacted, and may further impact our ability, desire, or the timing of seeking funding for various 
investment opportunities. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. 
Further, reduced U.S. federal government spending may limit demand for our products, services, and solutions from 
organizations that receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions 
in the United States, which could further reduce demand for our products, services, and solutions. 
Our business and financial performance also could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. trade policy, 
U.S. export controls and sanctions, and U.S. regulations concerning imports, as well as international laws and 
regulations relating to global trade. Current U.S. government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain 
foreign goods, including information and communication technology products. These measures have materially 
increased costs for certain goods imported into the United States. As a result, our business has in the past been 
impacted by forced material price increases, which in turn resulted in price increases for our offerings, which 
subsequently limited demand or reduced margins for our offerings, all of which may impact us again from time to 
27


Page 30:
time in the future. Additionally, U.S. trading partners may adopt their own trade policies making it more difficult or 
costly for us to export our products to those countries. Similarly, changes in regulations relating to exports could 
prevent us from exporting products to certain locations or customers entirely. In addition, changes in requirements 
relating to making foreign direct investments could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, 
prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for 
components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions. 
Sales outside the United States constituted approximately 64% of our net revenue in fiscal 2023. As such, our 
future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors in addition to those 
otherwise already disclosed, including: 
• ongoing uncertainties as a result of instability or changes in geopolitical conditions, including military or 
political conflicts, such as those caused by the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and 
Hamas (the potential escalation or geographic expansion of which could heighten other risks identified in this 
report), or the relationship between China and the U.S. (which could, among other things, impact the 
enforceability of certain contracts or the timing and form of certain payments); 
• inflationary pressures, such as those the market is currently experiencing, which have increased, and may 
continue to increase, costs for materials, supplies, and services; 
• adverse or uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including a rising interest rate environment and fears of a 
potential global economic downturn or recession, which have at times in the past slowed customer demand 
for our products and services, and may do so again in the future; 
• network security, privacy, and data sovereignty concerns, which could make foreign customers reluctant to 
purchase products and services from U.S.-based technology companies; 
• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers, which could impact our ability to collect on 
accounts receivable and consequently recognize revenue; 
• local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and OEMs, or 
changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and 
professional talent; 
• managing our geographically dispersed workforce, which has necessitated, and may in the future require, 
incurring costs to promote seamless workforce connectivity and to comply with changing laws, regulations 
and workers’ rights councils across multiple jurisdictions; 
• differing technology standards or customer requirements, which have required us to incur additional 
development and production costs to modify or adapt our offerings, and may do so again in the future; 
• local content and manufacturing requirements, which have impacted, and could further impact, our ability to 
sell into those markets; 
• difficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries, and changes in tax laws, which 
introduces uncertainty to our results of operations and financial performance; and 
• fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the 
transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and 
shipments, which have from time to time adversely impacted, and any of which could in the future adversely 
impact, our results of operations and ability to meet customer demand. 
Certain of the factors described above have, in the past, disrupted the operations of, and adversely impacted 
our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers, customers, or vendors located outside of the United 
States, and could do so again in the future. For example, we rely on suppliers in Asia for product assembly and 
manufacture, the operations of whom are subject to local labor laws and other requirements. Any loss of or 
limitations on their output or their inability to operate could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely deliver our 
products and services, which would in turn negatively impact our financial performance. 
Further, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the trade sanctions imposed by the U.S., the 
European Union (the “EU”), and other countries in response have negatively impacted business and financial 
performance in that region. HPE is proceeding with the exit of our remaining business in Russia and Belarus as 
planned; however, we cannot provide any assurance that such exit will be efficient or uninterrupted, which may 
negatively impact our operational expenses.  
We implement policies, procedures, and training designed to facilitate compliance with anti-corruption laws 
around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. But in many foreign 
28


Page 31:
countries, particularly in those with developing economies, people may engage in business practices prohibited by 
anti-corruption laws. Our employees and third parties we work with may take actions in violation of our policies, and 
those actions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. 
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen, and British pound have, from time 
to time, adversely impacted, and could in the future, have an adverse impact on our results as expressed in U.S. 
dollars. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. 
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have, from time to time, adversely affected, and could in future 
periods adversely affect our revenue recognition and our revenue growth. In addition, currency variations can 
adversely affect our ability to implement price increases, margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the 
United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of 
the United States. 
From time to time, we use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against 
foreign currency exchange rate risks, and may continue to do so in the future. The effectiveness of our hedges 
depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of 
uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant losses 
from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our 
hedging activities may be ineffective, may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion 
of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also 
may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition. 
Intellectual Property Risks 
Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license, or enforce the intellectual 
property rights on which our businesses depend. 
We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws in the United 
States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers, and other parties, 
to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide, or otherwise use 
in our operations. However, from time to time our intellectual property rights have been challenged, infringed, or 
circumvented, and any of such rights could be further challenged, invalidated, infringed, or circumvented or such 
intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to 
otherwise provide competitive advantages. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to 
the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our 
proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect 
our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position. 
Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third 
parties. 
Much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third 
parties. For example, many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual 
property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open source licenses. These third-party 
software components may become obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future versions of our products, our 
relationship with the third party may deteriorate or cease, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be 
terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of 
inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully 
monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source 
license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or 
on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are 
acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on 
favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of 
operations. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain 
licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were 
not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon 
the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license 
to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those 
granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual 
property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.

Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are commonplace in 
our industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and 
services. 
Third parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon or otherwise violating their 
intellectual property rights. Patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose 
of extracting infringement settlements. If we cannot license, or replace, allegedly infringed intellectual property on 
reasonable terms, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims 
are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management's attention 
and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to 
redesign affected products, discontinue certain product offerings, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, 
pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing, or 
selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying 
party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.
Financial Risks 
Adverse developments affecting our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs, and access to capital 
markets could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's 
Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings Services. Despite these investment grade credit ratings, any future downgrades 
could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our 
commercial paper, or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. Additionally, 
increased borrowing costs, including those arising from a credit rating downgrade, can potentially reduce the 
competitiveness of our financing business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit 
ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any 
announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, 
capital position, and access to capital markets. 
In addition, volatility and disruption in the financial sector and capital markets and other events negatively 
affecting macroeconomic conditions or contributing to the instability or volatility thereof, such as rising interest rates, 
have from time to time in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our liquidity, capital position, and access 
to capital markets. Our total liquidity depends in part on the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility and 
our other financing agreements. The failure of any lender's ability to fund future draws on our revolving credit facility 
or our other financing arrangements could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and 
additional capital for future needs. The future effects of such events are unknown and difficult to predict at this time, 
and could adversely affect us, our customers, financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or others with which 
we do business, which may in turn have adverse impacts on our current and/or projected business operations, 
financial condition, and our results of operations. 
Our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay 
dividends. 
In addition to our current total carrying debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This 
collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including requiring a 
substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments; making it more difficult 
to satisfy other obligations; increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase 
future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse 
economic and industry conditions; reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other 
corporate purposes and to grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our 
business and industry; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business 
opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock. 
Recent quantitative tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks around the world, 
have affected, and may continue to affect, our short-term ability to incur debt at reasonable prices, or our desire to 
incur debt at all. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In 
addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations 
may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we 
may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or 
refinance our debt. 
30


Page 33:
The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial 
results less predictable. 
Our revenue, gross margin, and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups, and 
geographic markets and therefore, will likely be different in future periods than our historical results. Our revenue 
depends on the overall demand for our products and services, which is difficult to accurately predict, varies from 
time to time, and may be uneven across our portfolio of offerings. Additionally, customer acceptances of delivered 
orders and the timing thereof can be uneven across our portfolio and can impact our ability to recognize revenue. 
Such variables have in the past negatively impacted our financial performance, and may do so again in the future. 
Delays or reductions in IT spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect 
on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, revenue 
declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling 
opportunities. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, 
service, customer, and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. 
Furthermore, the relationship between China and the U.S., and any subsequent action that may be taken by 
either country, may significantly vary the results our operations and financial performance from that region. There 
could be additional uncertainty surrounding the enforceability of contract obligations, as well as the timing and form 
of payments from China. 
Competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to 
pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions, and other risks affecting our businesses may have a 
significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Variations in our fixed cost structure and gross 
margins across business units and product portfolios, have from time to time led to, and may lead to significant 
operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. In addition, newer geographic market 
opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and 
local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure 
necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, 
competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts, 
and other factors have from time to time resulted in, and may in the future result in, reductions in revenue or 
pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. 
Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our 
financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from 
period to period. 
Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult 
and future financial results less predictable. 
In some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a 
disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales 
pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations, and working capital for each financial period 
difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places 
pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than 
orders, there may be excess inventory; and alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may 
not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled, all of which we 
experienced from time to time in the past and may do so again in the future. Depending on when they occur in a 
quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages, or global 
logistics disruptions, have in the past adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact, our inventory 
levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected. 
We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also have produced, and may in the future 
produce, variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. Many of the factors that create and affect 
seasonal trends are beyond our control. 
Separately, periodic supply chain shortages and constraints have, in some instances, resulted in, and may 
result in, increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we have, at times, not been able to, and 
may, in the future, not be able to pass on to our customers. We have, in some instances, responded to such 
constraints by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to 
secure manufacturing capacity. While these measures have been taken to shorten lead times to deliver products to 
customers, they may also result in excess or obsolete components in the future if the demand for our products is 
less than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Page 34:
We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial 
Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of 
operations. 
In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and 
assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described 
in the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In 
addition, as discussed in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Use of Estimates” 
and Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, we make 
certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we 
believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to 
significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions 
change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations. 
Regulatory and Government Risks 
Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in 
costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. Laws and regulations may 
change in ways that will require us to modify our business model and objectives or affect our returns on investments 
by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. For 
example, as a result of laws and regulations concerning the environment, we face increasing complexity related to 
product design, safety and compliance; the use of regulated, hazardous, and scarce materials; the management, 
movement and disposal of hazardous substances and waste; the associated energy consumption and efficiency 
related to operations and the use of products, services, and solutions; the discharge of pollutants into the air and 
water; the transportation and shipping of products and other materials; supply chain due diligence, and climate 
change, emissions and sustainability-related regulations and reporting requirements; the use of AI capabilities in our 
offerings; and the reuse, recycling and/or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life and 
associated operational or financial responsibility, as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our 
transition to a more circular economy. A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. 
Any changes to current environmental legal requirements, such as the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
Directive, the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, China's Administrative Measure on the 
Control of Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, the EU's Ecodesign Directive and product-specific 
implementing measures (including Lot 9 on servers and online data storage products), the evolving EU and US right 
to repair legal landscape, and India's regulation on e-waste collection and recycling, among others, may increase 
our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, U.S., China, India and/or 
other countries proposing or adopting similar environmental legal requirements. In addition, other ESG-related laws, 
regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed, adopted, and implemented throughout 
the world (including, but not limited to the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the EU Taxonomy, and 
the proposed EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive). If we were to violate or become liable under 
environmental or certain ESG-related laws or if our products become non-compliant with such laws or market 
access requirements, it could result in loss of market access or limit offerings in those markets or our customers 
may refuse to purchase our products, and we could incur costs or face other sanctions, such as restrictions on our 
products entering certain jurisdictions, fines, and/or civil or criminal sanctions. Environmental regulations may also 
impact the availability and cost of energy or emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost 
of manufacturing and/or the cost of powering and cooling owned IT infrastructures. 
In addition, our business is subject to an ever-growing number of laws addressing privacy and information 
security. In particular, we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future 
requirements relating to the security of our offerings. The increase in aaS offerings may also be impacted by data 
localization and international data transfer requirements under various privacy laws, including those arising from the 
Schrems II ruling in Europe. If we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy 
or security, we could incur substantial costs or be exposed to potential regulatory fines, civil or criminal sanctions, 
third-party claims, and reputational damage. 
Jurisdictions in which we have significant operations and assets, such as the U.S., China, India, and the E.U., 
each have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies 
including, but not limited to fair competition, tax practices, anti-corruption, anti-trust, price controls and international 
trade, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial 
condition. 
32


Page 35:
Contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governments are subject to a number of challenges and 
risks that may adversely impact our business. 
Our contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governmental customers are subject to various 
government procurement laws and regulations, required contract provisions, and other requirements relating to 
contract formation, administration, and performance, as well as local content, manufacturing, and security 
requirements. Any violation of government contracting laws and regulations or contract terms could result in the 
imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, 
suspension of payments and fines, treble damages, and suspension from future government contracting. Such 
failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, we will continue to be subject to qui tam 
litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts. If we are 
suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new government contracts is 
adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer. 
Government contracts impose additional challenges and risks to our sales efforts. Government demand and 
payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding 
authorizations, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown, with funding reductions, or 
delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services. Such developments could result in 
material payment delays, payment reductions, or contract terminations by our governmental customers, which in 
turn may adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of government contractors with whom we 
conduct business. This may cause those government contractors to become unable to meet their obligations under 
contracts with us.  
Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional 
tax liabilities could affect our financial performance. 
We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax 
liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, 
funding, and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree 
with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional 
taxes as a result. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the 
amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included 
in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash 
flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating 
structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of 
deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax 
return preparation process. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate 
future taxable income. 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 38 countries 
including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two 
framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. In December 2022, the EU member states 
adopted a directive that implements the Pillar Two framework, which is expected to be enacted into the national 
laws of the EU member states by December 31, 2023. Certain countries in which we operate have enacted 
legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework (e.g., United Kingdom and Korea), and several other countries are also 
considering changes to their tax laws to implement this framework. The first component of the Pillar Two framework 
is expected to be effective for us in fiscal 2025 with a second component expected to be effective in fiscal 2026. 
When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business could 
increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and 
non-U.S. jurisdictions.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation 
Reduction Act”) into law, which includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the “Corporate AMT”), beginning 
in fiscal 2024, of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) of corporations with average AFSI 
exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period.  We expect U.S. cash tax to increase in the short term as a result of 
the Corporate AMT but do not expect the effective tax rate to be impacted as the Corporate AMT is expected to be 
recovered as a credit in future years. 
During fiscal 2019, we executed a Termination and Mutual Release Agreement which terminated our Tax 
Matters Agreement with HP Inc. Because we now have limited indemnity rights from HP Inc., we potentially bear 
more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments.

Page 36:
Risks Related to Prior Separations 
The stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services 
business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC Technology 
Company or Micro Focus International plc (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us 
for any such tax liability imposed on us. 
The completed separations and mergers of our former Enterprise Services business with DXC Technology 
Company (“DXC”) (the “Everett Transaction” or “Everett”) and our Software Segment with Micro Focus International 
plc (“Micro Focus”) (the “Seattle Transaction” or “Seattle”) were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from 
outside counsel regarding the qualification of (i) the relevant distribution and related transactions as a 
“reorganization” within the meaning of Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the 
“Code”) and (ii) the relevant merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. While 
the Seattle Transaction generally qualified for tax-free treatment for us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, the 
acquisition of Seattle SpinCo by Micro Focus resulted in the recognition of gain (but not loss) for U.S. persons who 
received Micro Focus American Depositary Shares in the Software separation. 
Each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and 
assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us, Everett SpinCo and CSC, or 
us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, as applicable. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, 
or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation 
documents, the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be 
jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinions of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that 
either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, 
assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based 
are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of 
counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position. 
If the distribution of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, together with certain related 
transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under 
Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock 
of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders 
who receive Everett SpinCo shares or Seattle SpinCo shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if 
they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares. 
We obtained private letter rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to 
the separation of our Enterprise Services business and Software Segment. Those rulings concluded that certain 
transactions in those separations are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The conclusions of 
the IRS private letter rulings were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized 
and representations we have made to the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, 
inaccurate or incomplete, the validity of the IRS private letter rulings may be affected. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former Enterprise 
Services business and Software Segment, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the completed separation 
of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not 
legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material. If the completed separation of our former Enterprise 
Services business or Software Segment (including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those 
separations) are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are 
subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or DXC and/or Micro Focus could incur significant U.S. federal income tax 
liabilities. 
Under the tax matters agreements entered into by us with Everett SpinCo and CSC, and with Seattle SpinCo 
and Micro Focus, Everett SpinCo and Seattle SpinCo generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes 
resulting from the relevant separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts 
resulted from (i) certain actions taken by, or acquisitions of capital stock of, Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as 
applicable (excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation), or (ii) any breach of 
certain representations and covenants made by Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable. Any such 
indemnity obligations could be material. 
34


Page 37:
We continue to face a number of risks related to our separation from HP Inc., our former parent, including 
those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our financial 
condition and results of operations, and shared use of certain intellectual property rights, which could in 
the future adversely impact our reputation. 
In connection with our separation from HP Inc. on November 1, 2015 (the “Separation”), Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities 
between the companies following the Separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities 
and obligations. In these agreements, HP Inc. agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to 
indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are designed and intended to place financial 
responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations 
and liabilities of HP Inc.'s business with HP Inc. We may be obligated to fully indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities 
under the Separation agreements or HP Inc. may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us 
under the same Separation agreements. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, 
results of operations, and cash flows. 
In addition, the terms of the Separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain 
ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding 
structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of 
the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy 
branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of HP Inc. could also adversely 
affect our reputation. 
General Risks 
Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock 
difficult to predict. 
Investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results 
of operations, or cash flows. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile and can be 
affected by, among other things, speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community; the 
announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, 
divestitures, or other significant transactions by us or our competitors; developments in our transformation programs 
or in our transition to an as-a-service business model; our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates 
by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us; the financial results and business strategies of our 
competitors; inflation; market volatility or downturns caused by outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, geopolitical 
tensions or conflicts, or other macroeconomic dynamics; developments relating to pending investigations, claims, 
and disputes; or the timing and amount of our share repurchases. General or industry specific market conditions or 
stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our 
performance also may affect the price of our stock. Volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of 
securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management 
time and resources.

On October 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with a $3.0 
billion authorization, which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of $3.0 billion, $5.0 billion 
and $2.5 billion on May 24, 2016, October 16, 2017 and February 21, 2018, respectively. This program, which does 
not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. The 
Company may choose to repurchase shares when sufficient liquidity exists and the shares are trading at a discount 
relative to estimated intrinsic value. As of October 31, 2023 , the Company had a remaining authorization of 
approximately $1.0 billion for future share repurchases.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
For purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(“MD&A”) section, we use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to 
refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. 
This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 items and year-to-year 
comparisons between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Discussions of fiscal 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons 
between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part II, Item 7, 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company's Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year October 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on December 8, 2022, which is 
available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information 
that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in certain key items in 
those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as 
how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. This 
discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that 
appear elsewhere in this document.
This MD&A is organized as follows:
• Trends and Uncertainties. A discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management, such as 
the mixed macroeconomic environment, supply chain constraints (though easing), uneven demand across 
our portfolio, increased demand for and adoption of new technologies, conservative customer spending 
environment, inflationary trend and foreign exchange pressures, and recent tax developments.
• Executive Overview. A discussion of our business and a summary of our financial performance and other 
highlights, including non-GAAP financial measures, affecting the Company in order to provide context to the 
remainder of the MD&A.
• Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. A discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we 
believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported 
financial results.
• Results of Operations. A discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a 
discussion of the results of operations at the segment level.
• Liquidity and Capital Resources.  An analysis and discussion of changes in our cash flows, financial 
condition, liquidity, and cash requirements and commitments.
• GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation. Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This section also includes a discussion of the use, usefulness 
and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material 
limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial 
measures.

TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The elevated order book levels we experienced in fiscal 2022 have generally declined throughout fiscal 2023, 
as supply chain constraints eased (though challenges still remain) and demand softened unevenly across our 
portfolio (as a result of improving supply chain dynamics and as customers have been digesting their prior larger 
orders). Meanwhile, demand for and adoption of new technologies, such as AI, hybrid cloud, and edge computing, 
have increased. We have observed, and expect to continue seeing, customers of various segments and sizes 
pursue such new technologies. As noted above, we have continued to see elongated sales cycles, as customers 
work through prior orders and adopt a more conservative approach to spending in a mixed macroeconomic 
environment. This has been particularly true of certain of our hardware businesses, as customers have focused 
investments on modernizing infrastructure, such as migrating to cloud-based offerings. We expect such mixed 
macroeconomic environment to continue to moderate our revenue growth in the near term.
As referenced above, mild improvements to industry-wide supply constraints have helped to ease certain 
supply chain challenges we encountered in the recent past, including the increased availability of supply and lower 
material and logistics costs. Material cost trends are dependent on the strength or weakness of actual end-user 
demand and supply dynamics, which will continue to evolve and ultimately impact the translation of the cost 
environment to our pricing actions and, consequently, our operating results. Logistics costs continued to decrease 
from previously elevated levels as a result of declines in both expedited shipments and overall rate costs in the 
freight network. 
Additionally, we continue to experience a challenging foreign exchange environment, which has increased 
costs of products and services and moderated our revenue and earnings growth. We have a large global presence, 
with more than half of our revenue generated outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial results can be, and 
particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Furthermore, 
inflationary pressures persist, keeping not only material and logistics costs, but also labor costs, somewhat elevated 
compared to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. We expect the unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary 
trend to continue in the longer term. 
Recent Tax Developments
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 38 countries 
including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two 
framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. In December 2022, the EU member states 
adopted a directive that implements the Pillar Two framework, which is expected to be enacted into the national 
laws of the EU member states by December 31, 2023. Certain countries in which we operate have enacted 
legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework (e.g., United Kingdom and Korea), and several other countries are also 
considering changes to their tax laws to implement this framework. The first component of the Pillar Two framework 
is expected to be effective for us in fiscal 2025 with a second component expected to be effective in fiscal 2026. 
When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business could 
increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and 
non-U.S. jurisdictions.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction 
Act”) into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the “Corporate AMT”) 
of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 
billion over a three-year period. The Corporate AMT is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2024. We 
expect U.S. cash tax to increase in the short term as a result of the Corporate AMT but do not expect the effective 
tax rate to be impacted as the Corporate AMT is expected to be recovered as a credit in future years. The 
realizability of any deferred tax asset associated with the Corporate AMT will be determined through our annual 
valuation allowance analysis. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair 
market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The impact of this provision will be 
dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods.
The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is conducting audits of our fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income 
tax returns. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments (“NOPAs”) for 
fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 relating to our intercompany transfer pricing. After the close of fiscal 2023, the IRS 
issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal

years. The IRS is seeking to increase taxable income across the three fiscal years by $904 million. As of the 
balance sheet date, we have sufficient tax credit carryforwards to offset any incremental tax liability from the 
adjustments in the RAR. However, we disagree with the IRS’ adjustments and believe the positions taken on our tax 
returns are more likely than not to prevail on technical merits, and we will defend these positions through the IRS 
administrative processes, as necessary. Accordingly, no changes have been made to our reserves for uncertain tax 
positions in fiscal 2023 relating to the IRS’ adjustments.
Russia/Ukraine Conflict
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the U.S., European Union and 
other countries in response have negatively impacted our operations in both countries and increased economic and 
political uncertainty across the world. In response to the sanctions imposed, in February 2022, we suspended all 
new sales and shipments to Russia and Belarus and implemented compliance measures to address the 
continuously changing regulatory landscape. Based on a further assessment of business risks and needs, in June 
2022, we determined that it was no longer tenable to maintain our operations in Russia and Belarus and have been 
proceeding with an orderly, managed exit of our remaining business in these countries.
Other Trends and Uncertainties
We have observed market trends and demand gravitating towards AI, hybrid cloud, and edge computing, and 
data securities capabilities, and offerings. The volume of data at the edge continues to grow, driven by the 
proliferation of more devices, which has led to the need for enhanced security at the edge, as well. The need for a 
unified cloud experience everywhere has grown, as well, in order to manage the growth of data at the edge. With 
the abundance of data, there are opportunities to develop AI tools with powerful computational abilities to extract 
insights and value from the captured data. We expect these market dynamics and trends to continue in the longer 
term.
Observing these dynamics, we have accelerated our investment and innovation efforts in these areas that we 
see as critical to our long-term strategy and growth, including in pivoting our go-to-market motion and sales function. 
At the same time, we continue to strengthen our core Compute and Storage-oriented offerings and expand our 
offerings on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, to enable execution of our aaS pivot to become the edge-
to-cloud company for our customers and partners. Furthermore, as noted elsewhere in this report, effective 
November 1, 2023, we have realigned our financial reporting segments to align with these key market trends. It is 
uncertain whether we will successfully execute this shift in strategic focus, realize the anticipated benefits of doing 
so, or capture the anticipated shares of the AI, hybrid cloud, and edge markets.
The following Executive Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare 
fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2022, unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and, Cash Requirements and 
Commitments sections present information as of October 31, 2023, unless otherwise noted. 
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Net revenue of $29.1 billion represented an increase of 2.2% (increased 5.5% on a constant currency basis) 
primarily due to higher average unit prices (“AUPs”) in the Intelligent Edge and Compute segments, and higher 
customer acceptances in the High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence (“HPC & AI”) segment. The 
increase in net revenue was moderated by a decline in server unit volume in the Compute segment and unfavorable 
currency fluctuations. The gross profit margin of 35.1% (or $10.2 billion) represents an increase of 1.7 percentage 
points from the prior-year period due to the impact of higher-margin networking revenue, higher AUPs in Intelligent 
Edge and Compute, and lower supply chain and commodity costs. The operating profit margin of 7.2%, represents 
an increase of 4.5 percentage points primarily due to the aforementioned gross margin improvement, goodwill 
impairment charges for the HPC & AI and Software businesses in the prior-year period, and lower transformation 
expenses in the current period. The increase in operating profit margin was moderated by higher planned 
investments in research and development in the current period.

reconciliations, a discussion of the use, usefulness and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, 
along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of 
non-GAAP financial measures.
Annualized Revenue Run-rate (“ARR”)
Our pivot to aaS continues its strong momentum with the addition of HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. Our mix 
of ARR is becoming more software-rich as we build our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, which is improving 
our margin profile. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that 
brings our cloud operations model to wherever data lives by unifying data operations. The platform will be available 
through HPE GreenLake Central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software 
subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure at scale. We will continue to invest 
aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at 
the edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds. 
ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, 
related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from 
finance leases), and software-as-a-service, software consumption revenue, and other aaS offerings, recognized 
during a quarter and multiplied by four. We believe that ARR is a metric that allows management to better 
understand and highlight the potential future performance of our aaS business. We also believe ARR provides

investors with greater transparency to our financial information and of the performance metric used in our financial 
and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes of management.” We use 
ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be 
combined with it.
ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled 
measures presented by other companies. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting 
period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.
The following presents our ARR as of October 31, 2023 and 2022:
For the fiscal years ended October 31,
2023 2022
Dollars in millions
ARR $ 1,304 $ 936 
Year-over-year growth rate  39 %  17 %
The 39% year over year increase in ARR was due primarily to growth in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud 
platform, which was due to an expanding customer installed base and expanded range of offerings on the HPE 
GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. At the segment level, the growth was led by Intelligent Edge aaS and Storage 
aaS activity. 
Returning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, which also 
consists of strategic investments. We believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, along with 
commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, 
capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing 
operations. As of October 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $4.6 billion, compared to 
$4.8 billion as of October 31, 2022, representing a decrease of $0.2 billion. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (“GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. A summary of 
significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated 
Financial Statements are included in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of 
the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly 
uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other 
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under 
different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
We believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of 
operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Revenue Recognition
We enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in 
arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various 
services. 
The majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and 
maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred 
to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be 
offered in contracts with customers, partners, and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts,  
price protection, and other incentive programs. 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
43


Page 46:
Significant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable 
consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we 
estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the 
estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only 
to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' 
right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.
To recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the 
transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) 
basis. For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is generally not directly observable and requires the 
Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin 
objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable 
inputs.  For certain products and services, the Company establishes SSP based on the observable price when sold 
separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and 
services and reassesses them periodically.
Taxes on Earnings
We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ 
from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based 
on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the 
year in which we expect the differences to reverse.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not 
to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted 
earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent 
and feasible tax planning strategies.  In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate 
sufficient taxable income, of the appropriate character, in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are 
located, prior to their expiration under applicable tax laws.
Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for 
which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences 
indefinitely outside the U.S. We will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which 
deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated 
and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations, tax, or cash management reasons.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 85 other countries, and we are subject to 
routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns 
are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on 
examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to 
satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential 
assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts 
ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our 
income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our Provision for taxes, Net earnings and cash 
flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of 
our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany 
transactions and related interest, and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies. For further discussion on 
taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part 
II.

Goodwill
We review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or 
whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are 
permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative 
goodwill impairment test. 
As of October 31, 2023, our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified 
in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, with the exception of 
Corporate Investments and Other which contains five reporting units: Advisory and Professional Services, Athonet, 
legacy Communications and Media Solutions business, OpsRamp and Software. 
When performing the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying 
amount. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For two of our 
reporting units, Athonet and OpsRamp, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely 
than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount.  The qualitative assessment requires management 
judgement in assessing factors including, but not limited to, the macroeconomic and industry environment as well as 
Company-specific factors.  The assessments for Athonet and OpsRamp as of our test date indicated that it is not 
more likely than not that the fair values of these two reporting units are less than their carrying amounts.
For all of our other reporting units, we conduct a quantitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of a 
reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate 
the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived mostly from the income approach and, to 
a lesser extent, the market approach, with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting 
derived solely from the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of a reporting unit is based on 
discounted cash flow analysis of management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This 
analysis includes significant assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, expected operating margins, and timing 
of expected future cash flows based on market conditions and customer acceptances. The discount rate used is 
based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk 
associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute 
on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on market multiples of revenue and 
earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar 
to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of 
comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not 
meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. In addition, we 
make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to 
determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.
Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2023, did not result in any impairment charges. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units 
ranged from approximately 5% to 218% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% 
decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10% decrease all of the 
reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount, except for Compute.
The Compute reporting unit has goodwill of $7.7 billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over 
carrying value of 5% as of the annual test date. The Compute business is facing challenges reflected in the results 
for October 31, 2023. The Compute business is cyclical in nature. Over the last several years, digital transformation 
drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, in the current macroeconomic and inflationary 
environment, customers have slowed their investments resulting in lower server demand and competitive pricing. 
These dynamics are further compounded by higher supply chain costs. During this cycle, the Compute business 
continues to focus on capturing market share while maintaining operating margin.
The HPC & AI reporting unit has goodwill of $2.9 billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over 
carrying value of 12% as of the annual test date. The HPC & AI business continues to face challenges related to 
supply chain constraints of key components and other operational challenges impacting our ability to achieve 
certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated

with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. We currently believe these challenges will be 
successfully addressed as the supply chain constraints continue to improve. 
In addition, effective November 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024), there were organizational changes impacting the 
composition of our reporting units. These changes will require us to perform an interim impairment assessment as 
of that date. If the global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen, projected revenue growth rates or 
projected operating margins are not achieved, weighted average cost of capital increases, or if we have a significant 
sustained decline in our stock price, it is possible our estimates about the Compute, HPC & AI, or our other 
reporting units’ ability to successfully address the current challenges may change, which could result in the carrying 
value for our reporting units exceeding their estimated fair value resulting in potential impairment charges.
Our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill related to the 
HPC & AI and Software reporting units. There was no impairment of goodwill for our other reporting units.  
The decline in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit in fiscal 2022 below its carrying value resulted from 
changes in expected future cash flows due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational 
challenges as well as an increase in cost of capital. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $815 million was 
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.
The decline in the fair value of the Software reporting unit in fiscal 2022 resulted primarily from a decline in 
market multiples. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $90 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2022.  
Contingencies
We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to 
estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is 
probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably 
estimated. We review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, 
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular 
case.
Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and 
contingency matters further discussed in Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of Part II, are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability. Litigation is inherently 
unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. 
Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the 
resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such 
matters and, as of October 31, 2023, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in 
connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to 
represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect 
will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for 
assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year 
percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency 
exchange rates from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient 
of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates 
divided by (b) the prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the 
effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our 
revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, 
the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define 
similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022
Net revenue
In fiscal 2023, total net revenue of $29.1 billion represented an increase of $639 million, or 2.2% (increased 
5.5% on a constant currency basis). U.S. net revenue increased by $944 million, or 10.0% to $10.4 billion, and net 
revenue from outside of the U.S. decreased by $305 million, or 1.6%, to $18.7 billion.
The components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows:
For the fiscal years ended October 31,
2023 2022
Percentage Points
Compute  (5.0)  1.6 
HPC & AI  2.6  0.1 
Storage  (0.7)  (0.1) 
Intelligent Edge  5.4  1.3 
Financial Services  0.5  (0.2) 
Corporate Investments and Other  —  (0.4) 
Total segment  2.8  2.3 
Elimination of intersegment net revenue and other  (0.6)  0.3 
Total HPE  2.2  2.6 
Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022
From a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in total net revenue are 
summarized as follows:
• Compute net revenue decrease of $1,414 million, or 11.0%, primarily due to a decline in server unit volume 
and unfavorable currency fluctuations moderated by higher AUPs
• HPC & AI net revenue increase of $721 million, or 22.6%, primarily due to higher customer acceptances
• Storage net revenue decrease of $188 million, or 4.1%, primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations
• Intelligent Edge net revenue increase of $1,530 million, or 41.6%, primarily due to increased AUPs and 
volume and product mix effect
• Financial Services net revenue increase of $141 million, or 4.2%, primarily due to higher rental revenue 
from higher average operating leases and higher finance income on finance leases due to an increasing 
interest rate environment
• Corporate Investments and Other net revenue decrease of $5 million, or 0.4%, primarily due to unfavorable 
currency fluctuations 
Gross Profit
Fiscal 2023 total gross profit margin of 35.1% represents an increase of 1.7 percentage points as compared to 
the respective prior year period. The increase was due to the impact of higher-margin networking revenue, higher 
AUPs in  Intelligent Edge and Compute, and lower supply chain and commodity costs. Additionally, the increase 
was partially offset by lower gross profit from support services.
Operating expenses
Research and development (“R&D”)
R&D expense increased by $304 million, or 14.9%, led by Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI and Storage. The 
increase was driven by higher employee costs due to an increase in software engineers to pursue our strategic 
goals, which contributed 15.6 percentage points to the change.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Page 51:
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
SG&A expense increased by $219 million, or 4.4%, due primarily to higher travel and marketing expenses by 
1.8 percentage points; increased employee costs by 1.7 percentage points; factoring fees, charitable donations, 
other general expenses and higher software expenditures, all of which contributed 1.9 percentage points to the 
change. The increase was partially offset by a combination of lower consulting costs and cost savings from our 
transformation programs.
Impairment of goodwill
Impairment of goodwill for fiscal 2022 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of $905 million recorded 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC & AI and Software reporting 
units was below the carrying value of their net assets.
Transformation programs and costs 
Our transformation programs consist of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan (launched in 2020) and 
the HPE Next Plan (launched in 2017).  
Transformation costs decreased by $190 million, or 40.2%, due to lower charges incurred in the current period 
as these plans approach completion. Refer to Note 3, “Transformation Programs” to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of Part II for further discussion.
         Disaster charges 
Disaster charges decreased by $47 million or 97.9% due to charges recorded in fiscal 2022 driven by the 
Company’s exit from its Russia and Belarus businesses. 
Interest and other, net
Interest and other, net expense decreased by $32 million, due to favorable currency fluctuations and an 
increase in net interest income from higher interest rates, partially offset by an increase in impairments recorded on 
equity investments in fiscal 2023.
Tax indemnification and other adjustments 
We record changes in certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we 
remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification.
We recorded Tax indemnification and other adjustments income of $55 million and expense of $67 million in 
fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
In fiscal 2023, Tax indemnification and other adjustments included the favorable settlement of tax 
indemnification liabilities for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities. In fiscal 2022, Tax indemnification and other 
adjustments resulted from changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities, for which we partially shared joint and 
several liability with HP Inc. and for which we were indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release 
Agreement, and changes to certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables. 
Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit
Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs, 
other than service cost, for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit 
plans such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and the amortization of prior plan amendments and 
actuarial gains or losses. The benefit (cost) credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements, curtailments, or 
special termination benefits. 
In fiscal 2023, Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit decreased by $137 million resulting in non-service 
net periodic benefit cost of $3 million in the current period, as compared to non-service net periodic benefit credit of 
$134 million in fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to higher interest cost as a result of higher discount rates, 
partially offset by higher expected returns on assets and lower amortized actuarial losses in the current period.

Earnings from equity interests
Earnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49% interest in H3C Technologies Co., Limited (“H3C”) 
and the amortization of our interest in a basis difference. In fiscal 2023, Earnings from equity interests increased by 
$30 million due primarily to lower amortization expense from basis difference in the current period.
Provision for taxes 
For fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $205 million and $8 million, respectively, which 
reflect effective tax rates of 9.2% and 0.9%, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. 
federal statutory rate of 21% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower 
tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the 
fiscal year. Our tax rate for fiscal 2022 also included the effects of the non-deductible goodwill impairment. The 
jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods 
presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore. 
In fiscal 2023, we recorded $131 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These 
amounts primarily included:
• $104 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other 
related charges and
• $19 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
In fiscal 2022, we recorded $454 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These 
amounts primarily included:
• $150 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances,
• $99 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other 
related charges,
• $43 million of income tax benefits related to the settlement of U.S. tax audit matters,
• $42 million of income tax benefits related to the release of U.S. passive foreign tax credit valuation 
allowance,
• $30 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for 
which we shared joint and several liability with, and for which we were indemnified by, HP Inc.,
• $27 million of income tax benefits related to the utilization of capital losses which had a full valuation 
allowance,
• $12 million of income tax benefits as a result of the fiscal 2021 U.S. tax return filing primarily from the 
decrease in Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, and
• $11 million of net income tax benefits related to settlements and ongoing discussions in foreign tax audit 
matters.
Segment Information
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (“CODM”), who is the CEO, uses to evaluate, view, and run our business operations, which include, 
but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this 
organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate 
segment results.
A description of the products and services for each segment, along with other pertinent information related to 
Segments can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of

Compute net revenue decreased by $1,414 million, or 11.0% (decreased 7.1% on a constant currency basis), 
primarily due to a $1,424 million, or 14.3%, decrease in product revenue. The decline in product revenue was 
primarily due to lower server unit volume of $1,889 million, or 18.9%, and unfavorable currency fluctuations of $399 
million. The product revenue decline was moderated by an increase in AUPs of $864 million, or 8.7%, led by higher 
sales of server configurations with more complex component architectures in our next generation products.
Compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.5 percentage points primarily 
due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by a decrease in the cost 
of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of 
net revenue was primarily due to the scale of the net revenue decline. The decrease in costs of products and 
services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to higher AUPs moderated by unfavorable currency

HPC & AI net revenue increased by $721 million, or 22.6% (increased 25.2% on a constant currency basis), 
primarily due to a $759 million, or 33.6%, increase in product revenue. The product revenue increase was led by the 
HPE Cray Supercomputing product portfolio, as operational and supply improvements addressed challenges with 
achieving certain customer acceptance milestones for revenue recognition. HPE Cray Supercomputing experienced 
a deal volume increase of $991 million, or 43.9 %, moderated by lower AUPs of $358 million, or 15.8%. The product 
revenue was also impacted by unfavorable currency fluctuation of $69 million. Services revenue declined by $38 
million, or 4.1%, primarily due to unfavorable portfolio mix of service offerings.
HPC & AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat, driven by a 
decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by an increase in costs of products 
and services as a percentage of net revenue.

Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022
Storage net revenue decreased by $188 million, or 4.1% (decreased 0.7% on a constant currency basis) 
primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and a decrease in AUPs. Storage product revenue decreased by 
$187 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations of $122 million, a decrease in AUPs of $21 
million, or 0.8%, led by HPE Alletra Storage portfolio and big data, a unit volume decrease of $25 million, or 0.9%, 
led by HPE Alletra Storage portfolio and moderated by big data, and lower revenue from Russia of $20 million. 
Storage services revenue remained relatively flat.  
Storage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decr eased 4.2 percentage points due to 
increases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage 
of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to 
unfavorable currency fluctuations partially offset by lower supply chain costs. The increase in operating expenses as

a volume and product mix effect of $236 million, or 7.9%, moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations of $106 
million. The product revenue increase was led by switching and wireless local area network products, which 
benefited from improvements in the supply availability, and elevated order book levels at the beginning of the 
period. Services net revenue increased $143 million, or 20.6%, primarily led by our aaS and attached support 
service offerings. 
Intelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 12.4 percentage points 
primarily due to decreases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses 
as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was 
primarily due to lower supply chain costs, moderating the decrease was a lower mix of higher-margin support

primarily to higher rental revenue from higher average operating leases and higher finance income on finance 
leases due to an increasing interest rate environment, partially offset by lower asset management revenue primarily 
from lower pre-owned asset sales and unfavorable currency fluctuations.
FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 2.8 percentage points due primarily to 
an increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue, while operating expenses as a percentage of net 
revenue were relatively flat. The increase to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from 
a combination of higher borrowing costs and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower bad debt 
expense.

Financing volume $ 6,412 $ 6,252 $ 6,168 
Financing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related 
software and services, including intercompany activity, increased by 2.6% in fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior-
year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher financing of HPE product sales and services, partially 
offset by lower financing of third-party product sales and services and unfavorable currency fluctuations.
Portfolio Assets and Ratios
The FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance 
against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal 
management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as

those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment 
balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for FS were as follows:
 As of October 31

(1) Intercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation.
(2) Allowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions.
(3) Debt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany 
debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled $11.6 
billion and $11.5 billion at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-
equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at 
October 31, 2023 and 2022, was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.
As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, FS net cash and cash equivalents balances were $700 million and $923 
million, respectively.
Net portfolio assets as of October 31, 2023 increased 4.3% from October 31, 2022. The increase generally 
resulted from new financing volume exceeding portfolio runoff during the period, along with favorable currency 
fluctuations. 
FS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves and write-offs for sales-type, 
direct-financing and operating leases. FS recorded net bad debt expense of $59 million, $82 million and $95 million 
in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

revenue. The increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to unfavorable currency 
fluctuations, higher services delivery costs and higher variable compensation expense. The increase in operating 
expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Current Overview 
We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated 
cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product 
development initiatives, acquisitions and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, 
transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to 
any future investments, share repurchases, and stockholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this 
short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under 
credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital 
markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic 
conditions. We anticipate that the funds made available and cash generated from operations along with our access 
to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the 
foreseeable future thereafter. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section 
entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative 
Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A.
Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held 
outside the U.S as of October 31, 2023. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to 
provide availability of our worldwide cash when and where it is needed.
Amounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support our non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations 
of amounts held outside the U.S. generally should not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be 
subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer 
of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash 
flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on the repatriation of 
amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of 
operations.
In connection with the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, during fiscal 
2023, we repurchased and settled an aggregate amount of $0.4 billion. As of October 31, 2023, we had a remaining 
authorization of approximately $1.0 billion  for future share repurchases. For more information on our share 
repurchase program, refer to Note 15, “Stockholders' Equity,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of 
Part II.
Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among our relevant subsidiaries, Unisplendour International 
Technology Limited (“UNIS”), and H3C dated as of May 1, 2016, as amended from time to time, and most recently 
on October 28, 2022, we delivered a notice to UNIS on December 30, 2022, to exercise our right to put to UNIS, for 
cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by us, which represent 49% of the total issued share capital of H3C. 
On May 26, 2023, our relevant subsidiaries entered into a Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby 
UNIS has agreed to purchase all of the H3C shares held by us, through our subsidiaries, for a total pre-tax cash 
consideration of $3.5 billion. We intend to consider a range of allocation activities, in line with our practice of 
pursuing a balanced, returns-based approach for capital allocation decisions, including but not limited to organic 
and strategic investments, return of capital to shareholders, repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt, and 
general corporate purposes. The disposition remains subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and 
completion of certain conditions necessary for closing.

cash $ (182) $ 431 $ (289) 
Free Cash Flow $ 2,238 $ 1,794 $ 1,551 
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decrease d by $165 million for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 
2022. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable working capital primarily resulting from higher vendor 
payments and an increase in financing receivables, moderated by unfavorable hedging positions, lower cash 
payouts for variable compensation, and favorable impacts from other assets and liabilities during the current period.
Our working capital metrics and cash conversion impacts were as follows:
 As of October 31,
 2023 2022 2021
Days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable (“DSO”)  43  47  49 
Days of supply in inventory (“DOS”)  87  88  82 
Days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable (“DPO”)  (134)  (149)  (128) 
Cash conversion cycle  (4)  (14)  3 
The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash 
conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in 
payment terms (including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers), early or late invoice payments 
from customers or to suppliers, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of revenue 
recognition and inventory purchases within the period, the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity.

DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing 
ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. Compared 
to the three-month period ending October 31, 2022, the decrease in DSO by 4 days in the current period was 
primarily due to higher early collections and receivables factoring.
DOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by 
dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month 
period ending October 31, 2022, the DOS remained relatively flat. 
DPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is 
calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the 
corresponding three-month period ending October 31, 2022, the decrease in DPO by 15 days in the current period 
was primarily due to lower inventory purchases during the current period.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The 
increase was primarily due to payments made in connection with business acquisitions of $0.8 billion, higher cash 
utilized in net financial collateral activities of $0.5 billion, lower proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, 
net of purchases of $0.2 billion, offset by lower investment in property, plant and equipment of $0.3 billion, as 
compared to the prior-year period.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The 
decrease was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from debt, net of issuance costs of $1.4 billion, offset by 
higher repayments of debt and short-term borrowings of $1.0 billion, as compared to the prior-year period.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow (“FCF”) represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in 
property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of 
exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF increased by $0.4 billion in fiscal 
2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, due to a favorable currency impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted 
cash, lower cash utilized for investments in PP&E, moderated by lower cash provided from operations, as compared 
to the prior-year period. For more information on our FCF, refer to the section entitled “GAAP to non-GAAP 
Reconciliations” included in this MD&A.
For more information on the impact from operating assets and liabilities to cash flows, see Note 7, “Balance 
Sheet Details,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

activities, our cost of capital, and targeted capital structure. We maintain a revolving credit facility and two 
commercial paper programs, "the Parent Programs", and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. 
There have been no changes to our commercial paper programs and revolving credit facility since October 31, 
2022.

In December 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
allows us to sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, preferred stock, 
common stock, warrants, depository shares, purchase contracts, guarantees or units consisting of any of these 
securities. The shelf registration statement expired in December 2023, and we expect to file a new shelf registration 
statement around the time of the filing of this report.
Significant funding and liquidity activities for fiscal 2023 were as follows:
Debt Issuances:
• In March 2023 and June 2023, we issued $1.3 billion and $250 million, respectively, of 5.90% Senior Notes 
due October 1, 2024
• In March 2023, we issued $400 million of 6.102% Senior Notes due April 1, 2026
• In March and April 2023, we issued $643 million of asset-backed debt securities in five tranches with a 
weighted average interest rate of 5.59% and final maturity date of April 20, 2028
• In June 2023, we issued $550 million of 5.25% Senior Notes due July 1, 2028
• In September 2023, we issued $612 million of asset-backed debt securities in six tranches with a weighted 
average interest rate of 6.40% and final maturity date of July 21, 2031.
Debt Repayments:
• In April 2023, we repaid $1.0 billion of 2.25% fixed rate Senior Notes
• In October 2023, we repaid $1.25 billion of 4.45% Senior Notes
• During fiscal 2023, we repaid $1.7 billion of the outstanding asset-backed debt securities. 
Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the 
period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13, 
“Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
For more information on our available borrowing resources and the impact of operating assets and liabilities to 
cash flows, see Note 14, “Borrowings,” and Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” respectively, to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
Cash Requirements and Commitments 
Long-term debt and interest payments on debt
As of October 31, 2023 , future principal payment obligations on our long-term debt including asset-backed 
debt securities totaled $11.7 billion of which $4.0 billion is due within one year. As of October 31, 2023, our finance 
lease obligations, including interest, was $48 million, of which $6 million is to be due within one year. For more 
information on our debt, see Note 14, “Borrowings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
As of October 31, 2023 , future interest payments relating to our long-term debt is estimated to be 
approximately $3.5 billion, of which $0.6 billion is expected to be due within one year. We use interest rate swaps to 
mitigate the exposure of our fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or 
hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate debt. The impact of our 
outstanding interest rate swaps as of October 31, 2023  was factored into the calculation of the future interest 
payments on long-term debt.
Operating lease obligations 
We enter into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, vehicles, and 
aviation. As of October 31, 2023, operating lease obligations, net of sublease rental income totaled $1.6 billion, of 
which $216 million is due within one year. These amounts included uncommenced operating leases as of October 
31, 2023, and did not reflect imputed interest adjustments. For more information on our leases, see Note 8, 
“Accounting for Leases as a Lessee,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

Unconditional purchase obligations 
Our unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, software maintenance 
and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable 
without penalty. As of October 31, 2023 , unconditional purchase obligations totaled $1.6 billion , of which 
$580 million is due within one year. For more information on our unconditional purchase obligations, see Note 19, 
“Commitments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
Retirement Benefit Plan Funding
In fiscal 2024, we anticipate making contributions of $182 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is 
to fund pension plans to meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities 
including local government and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-
retirement benefit plans are not considered as contractual obligations because they do not represent contractual 
cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more 
information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement 
Benefit Plans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
Restructuring Plans
As of October 31, 2023, we expect future cash payments of approximately $360 million in connection with our 
approved restructuring plans, which includes $240 million expected to be paid in fiscal 2024 and $120 million 
expected to be paid thereafter. Payments for restructuring activities are not considered as contractual obligations, 
because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these 
payments. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3, “Transformation Programs,” to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of October 31, 2023 , we had approximately $224 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and 
penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $9 million 
expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to 
when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. 
Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our 
uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part 
II.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships 
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or 
special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other 
contractually narrow or limited purposes.
We have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital 
requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing 
arrangements, see Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the 
business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from 
operations, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and FCF. These 
non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a 
constant currency basis is net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is 
gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. 
The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP earnings from operations is earnings from operations. 
The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from 
operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of 
net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The 
GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most 
directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP 
measure most directly comparable to FCF is cash flow from operations.
We believe that providing the non-GAAP measures stated above, in addition to the related GAAP measures 
provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows 
the reader of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of 
management. We further believe that providing this information provides investors with a supplemental view to 
understand our historical and prospective
operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to 
evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates 
comparisons of our operating performance with the performance of other companies in the same industry that 
supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.
Economic Substance of non-GAAP Financial Measures
Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the 
comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating our past and future performance, 
without the impact of foreign exchange rates, as more than half of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S.
We believe that excluding the items mentioned below from the non-GAAP financial measures provides a 
supplemental view to management and our investors of our consolidated financial performance and presents the 
financial results of the business without costs that we do not believe to be reflective of our ongoing operating 
results. Exclusion of these items can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus 
limiting the use of such non-GAAP financial measures as analytic tools. See “Compensation for Limitations With 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for further information.
Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges related to the 
amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense, and disaster charges. See below for the 
reasons management excludes each item:
• Amortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal 
years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. We exclude these costs as we 
elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, we did not adjust these 
historical costs to accumulated deficit. We believe that most financing companies did not elect this practical 
expedient and therefore we exclude these costs. This can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP 
measures and Financial Services segment results.
• Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of 
those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our 
employees, we exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily 
because they are non-cash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry 
participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation 
expense.

Page 65:
• Disaster (recovery) charges are primarily related to the exit of our businesses in Russia and Belarus, and 
include credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets. 
Disaster (recovery) charges also include direct costs or recovery of these costs related to COVID-19 as a 
result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and subsequent 
shift to a virtual format. While we present various items as Disaster charges (recovery), we exclude Disaster 
charges (recovery) from these non-GAAP measures as the specific charges are non-recurring charges and 
not indicative of the operational performance of our business.
Non-GAAP earnings from operations and non-GAAP operating profit margin consist of earnings from 
operations or earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue excluding the items mentioned above and 
charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, goodwill impairment, transformation costs and acquisition, 
disposition and other related charges. In addition to the items previously explained above, management excludes 
these items for the following reasons:
• We incur charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and exclude these charges for purposes 
of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and 
magnitude of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP 
measures, primarily because they are noncash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence 
that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset 
amortization. Although this does not directly affect our cash position, the loss in value of intangible assets 
over time can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure. 
• In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recorded an impairment charge for the 
goodwill associated with its HPC & AI and Software reporting units following the annual goodwill impairment 
review. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP 
measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of  current operating performance and comparisons to 
operating performance in other periods.
• Transformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and 
Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to 
transform our IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment charges on real 
estate identified as part of the initiatives. We exclude these costs as they are discrete costs related to two 
specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017 and 2020, respectively, as multi-year 
programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure following material divestiture 
transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product portfolio in fiscal 2020. The 
primary elements of the HPE Next and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan have been substantially 
completed by October 31, 2023. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from our non-GAAP 
financial measures as stated above is to provide a supplemental measure of our operating results that does 
not include material HPE Next Plan and Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as we do not 
believe such costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating cost structure. Further as our transformation 
costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have been materially declining since 2021 and 
we do not expect to incur material transformation costs related to these programs beyond fiscal 2023, we 
believe non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to management and investors for comparing 
operating performance across multiple periods.
• We incur costs related to our acquisition, disposition and other related charges. The charges are direct 
expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-
capitalized expenses. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal 
and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. We exclude these costs as these 
expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature 
of our acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many 
industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges.
Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net 
earnings per share excluding those same charges mentioned above, as well as other items such as tax 
indemnification and other adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit cost (credit), earnings from equity interests, 
impairment of investment, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain income

tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess tax 
benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each 
non-GAAP item. In addition to the items previously explained, management excludes these items for the following 
reasons:
• Tax indemnification and other adjustments are primarily related to changes to certain pre-separation and 
pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or 
divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. We exclude these income or charges 
and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation 
of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.
• Non-service net periodic benefit cost (credit) includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, 
(ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains 
or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related 
factors associated with our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven 
retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which 
are tied to financial market performance. We exclude these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-
GAAP measures and consider them to be outside the operational performance of the business. 
• Adjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to 
the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, 
this adjustment also included our portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. We believe that 
eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our 
current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.
• In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, HPE recorded an impairment charge for an equity investment resulting 
from a permanent reduction of the investee’s assets. This adjustment was reflected in Interest and other, 
net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We believe eliminating impairment of investment for the 
purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance 
and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods. 
• We utilize a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide consistency across 
the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to our operating 
structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, we evaluated a three-
year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year 
projection period and considers other factors including our expected tax structure, our tax positions in 
various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where we 
operate. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, we used a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%. The non-GAAP income 
tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax 
environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or 
other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. 
We believe that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a 
supplemental evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.
FCF is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash flow from operations, excluding the impact of proceeds 
received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 from a one-time Itanium litigation judgment, less net capital expenditures 
(investments in PP&E less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate 
fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the total increase or decrease 
in cash for the period. Our management and investors can use FCF for the purpose of determining the amount of 
cash available for investment in our businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating our 
historical and prospective liquidity.
Compensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be 
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations 
in relying on these non- GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP 
earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other companies (limiting the usefulness

of those measures for comparative purposes) and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of 
certain assets.
We compensate for these limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our 
GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. We also provide a reconciliation of 
each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this fiscal year and 
prior periods, and we encourage investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks 
that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to 
these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to 
manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. 
Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for 
each of these exposures is outlined below.
Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in 
the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures 
and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related 
exposure.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, 
anticipated purchases, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact 
business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our 
operations for fiscal 2023 were the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. For most currencies, we are a net 
receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a 
stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a 
weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.
We use a combination of forward contracts and, from time to time, options designated as cash flow hedges to 
protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser 
extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. 
dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign 
currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, 
consisting primarily of forward contracts, to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may 
choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a 
natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too 
expensive to hedge.
We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, using a modeling technique that 
measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign 
currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of 
our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we 
used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency 
exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $48 million and $49 million at October 31, 2023 
and 2022, respectively.
Interest rate risk
We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued, our debt investment portfolio and net 
portfolio assets of our Financial Services segment. We issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign 
currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing.
We often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the 
debt to achieve U.S. dollar based floating or fixed interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the 
exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, in circumstances where we believe additional fixed-rate 
debt would be beneficial, we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap, or swap certain floating interest 
payments to fixed.
We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, using a modeling technique that 
measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of interest 
rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, debt 
investments, net portfolio assets, and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the 
debt, debt investments, net portfolio assets, and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the 
market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a 
66


Page 69:
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt, debt 
investments and net portfolio assets, net of interest rate swaps, of $41 million and $32 million at October 31, 2023 
and 2022, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and 
subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, 
comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 
31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, 
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at 
October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended October 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified 
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks 
of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial 
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to 
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, 
subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit 
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which 
they relate.
Valuation of goodwill
Description of the 
matter
At October 31, 2023, the Company’s goodwill was $18 billion, of which $7.7 billion 
related to the Compute reporting unit and $2.9 billion related to the High Performance 
Computing and Artificial Intelligence (“HPC & AI”) reporting unit. As discussed in Note 
11 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least 
annually at the reporting unit level and more frequently when warranted based on 
indicators of impairment. Auditing management’s goodwill impairment test for the 
Compute and HPC & AI reporting units was complex and highly judgmental due to the 
significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting units. In 
particular, the fair value estimates of the Compute and HPC & AI reporting units were 
sensitive to significant assumptions, such as changes in the weighted average cost of 
capital, revenue growth rate, operating margin and terminal value, which are affected 
by expectations about future market or economic conditions.
69


Page 72:
How we addressed 
the matter in our 
audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process, 
including controls over the significant assumptions described above. 
To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s Compute and HPC & AI reporting 
units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing 
methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the 
underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant 
assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and 
evaluated whether changes to the Company’s business model, product mix and other 
factors would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of 
management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions 
to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from 
changes in the assumptions.
In addition, we tested management’s reconciliation of the fair value of all the reporting 
units to the market capitalization of the Company. We involved our valuation 
professionals to evaluate the application of valuation methodologies in the Company’s 
annual impairment test.
Estimation of variable consideration
Description of the 
matter
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company 
recognizes revenue for sales to its customers after deducting management’s estimates 
of variable consideration which may include various rebates, volume-based discounts, 
price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, partners, 
and distributors. Estimated variable consideration is presented within other accrued 
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and totaled $1.1 billion at October 31, 
2023. Auditing the estimates of variable consideration associated with rebates was 
complex and judgmental due to the level of uncertainty involved in management’s 
estimate of expected usage of these programs.
How we addressed 
the matter in our 
audit 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process for estimating rebates, including 
controls over the significant assumptions described above.
To test the Company’s determination of variable consideration we performed audit 
procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodologies, testing the 
significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of 
the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant 
assumptions to historical experience of the Company to develop an expectation of the 
rebates associated with product remaining in the distribution channel at October 31, 
2023, which we compared to management’s recorded amount. In addition, we 
inspected the underlying agreements and compared the incentive rates used in the 
Company’s analyses with contractual rates. We assessed the historical accuracy of 
management’s estimates by comparing previous estimates of rebate liabilities to the 
amount of actual payments in subsequent periods.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial 
reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In 
our opinion, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material 
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the 
related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each 
of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated December 22, 
2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting 
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Background
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” or the “Company”) is a global 
technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon 
data seamlessly from edge to cloud. Hewlett Packard Enterprise enables customers to accelerate business 
outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing 
operational efficiency today and into the future. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's customers range from small- and 
medium-sized businesses to large global enterprises and governmental entities.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles (“GAAP”). 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its 
subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All 
intercompany transactions and accounts within the consolidated businesses of the Company have been eliminated.
The Company consolidates a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) where it has been determined that the Company 
is the primary beneficiary of the entity's operation. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb 
losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether 
the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its power to direct the most significant activities of 
the VIE by considering the purpose and design of the entity and the risks the entity was designed to create and 
pass through to its variable interest holders. The Company also evaluates its economic interests in the VIE.
The Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant 
influence but does not hold a controlling interest under the equity method of accounting, and the Company records 
its proportionate share of income or losses in Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of 
Earnings. 
Non-controlling interests are presented as a separate component within Total stockholders' equity in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests are recorded within Interest and 
other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately, as they were not material 
for any periods presented.
Segment Realignment
Effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, in order to align its segment financial reporting 
more closely with its current business structure, the Company implemented an organizational change with the 
transfer of certain storage networking products, previously reported within the Storage reportable segment, to the 
Compute reportable segment. The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to 
the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the realignment of net revenue and operating profit for 
each of the segments as described above. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s 
previously reported consolidated net revenue, net earnings, net earnings per share (“EPS”) or total assets.
Russia/Ukraine Conflict
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the U.S., European Union and 
other countries in response have negatively impacted the Company's operations in both countries and increased 
economic and political uncertainty across the world. In response to the sanctions imposed, in February 2022, the 
Company suspended all new sales and shipments to Russia and Belarus and implemented compliance measures 
to address the continuously changing regulatory landscape. Based on a further assessment of business risks and 
needs, in June 2022, the Company determined that it was no longer tenable to maintain its operations in Russia and 
Belarus and has been proceeding with an orderly, managed exit of its remaining business in these countries.
During fiscal 2022, the Company recorded total pre-tax charges of $161 million primarily related to expected 
credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets, $99 million of which

was included in Financing cost, $12 million  in Cost of services and $50 million  in Disaster charges in the 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions 
that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are 
assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, including those related to revenue recognition, 
stock-based compensation, net periodic benefit costs, restructuring accruals, provision for taxes, valuation 
allowance for deferred taxes, provision for expected credit losses, inventory reserves, and impairment assessments 
of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The Company believes that these estimates, judgments 
and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of 
which are beyond the Company's control. Should any of these estimates change, it could adversely affect the 
Company's results of operations. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different 
assumptions or conditions.  
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated 
in non-U.S. currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities 
and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses 
denominated in non-U.S. currencies are recorded in U.S. dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during 
the period. The Company includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net in 
the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and gains and losses from cash flow hedges in Net revenue as the 
hedged revenue is recognized. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional 
currency, and the Company records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance 
sheet date as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Revenue Recognition
The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when both parties have provided written approval and 
are committed to perform, each party's rights including payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial 
substance, and collection of consideration is probable. 
The Company enters into contracts with customers that typically include combinations of products and 
services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products 
and/or various services. The Company determines whether each product or service is distinct in order to identify the 
performance obligations in the contract and allocate the contract transaction price among the distinct performance 
obligations. Arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its 
own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether the commitment to transfer the product 
or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. The Company classifies 
its hardware, perpetual software licenses, service arrangements and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) as distinct 
performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and 
software maintenance. In transactions where the Company delivers hardware or software, it is typically the principal 
and records revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.
The majority of the Company's revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated 
support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is 
transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be 
entitled, in exchange for those products or services. Variable consideration offered in contracts with customers, 
partners and distributors may include rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive 
programs. Variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period 
as additional information becomes available and recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant 
reversal of revenue will not occur.
Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon 
shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over 
time for maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. The Company's

hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront 
upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses 
are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized 
ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements have one distinct 
performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the 
customer consumes the services. On its product sales, the Company records consideration from shipping and 
handling on a gross basis within net product sales. Revenue is recorded net of any associated sales taxes.
The Company allocates the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative 
standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price (“SSP”) is the price at which an entity would sell a 
promised product or service separately to a customer. For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is 
generally not directly observable and requires the Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by 
considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, 
historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs.  For certain products and services, the Company 
establishes SSP based on the observable price when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. 
The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically.
Judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as the Company may be required to estimate variable 
consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration may include various 
rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, 
partners and distributors. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, the Company estimates the 
expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and updates the estimate at 
each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. The Company also considers the customers' right of 
return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.
Contract Balances
Accounts receivable and contract assets
A receivable is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services the Company has transferred to a 
customer that is unconditional. A contract asset is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services 
transferred to a customer that is conditional on something other than the passage of time. A receivable is recorded 
when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.  
The Company's contract assets include unbilled receivables which are recorded when the Company 
recognizes revenue in advance of billings. Unbilled receivables generally relate to services contracts where a 
service has been performed and control has transferred, but invoicing to the customer is subject to future milestone 
billings or other contractual payment schedules. The Company classifies unbilled receivables as Accounts 
receivable.
Contract liabilities
A contract liability is an obligation to transfer products or services to a customer for which the Company has 
received consideration, or the amount is due, from the customer. The Company's contract liabilities primarily consist 
of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is recorded when amounts invoiced to customers are in excess of revenue 
that can be recognized because performance obligations have not been satisfied and control of the promised 
products or services has not transferred to the customer. Deferred revenue largely represents amounts invoiced in 
advance for product (hardware/software) support contracts, consulting projects and product sales where revenue 
cannot be recognized yet.
Costs to obtain a contract with a customer
The Company capitalizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, primarily sales 
commissions, if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, 
to expense the costs of obtaining a contract as incurred for contracts with terms of one year or less. The typical 
amortization periods used range from two to five years. The Company periodically reviews the capitalized sales 
commission costs for possible impairment losses. The amortization of capitalized costs to obtain a contract are 
included in Selling, general and administrative expense. Refer to Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details” for additional 
information.

Shipping and Handling
The Company includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of products.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense is based on the measurement date fair value of the award and is 
recognized only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. Stock-based 
compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units with only a service condition is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For stock options and restricted stock units with 
both a service condition and a performance or market condition, the expense is recognized on a graded vesting 
basis over the requisite service period of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is determined at the 
aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with 
performance and/or market conditions. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience.
Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans
The Company has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory, retirement and post-
retirement plans. The costs and obligations for these plans depend on various assumptions. Major assumptions 
relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-
term return on plan assets. These assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in 
Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.”
The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities 
with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan 
participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. The expected increase in the 
compensation levels assumption reflects long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-
term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset 
correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. In any fiscal year, significant differences may 
arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between 
the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset 
allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences 
between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the 
use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. 
The following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions of discount rates, the 
expected increase in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on the 
net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2023:

The Company generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the 
average remaining estimated service life or, in the case of closed plans, life expectancy of participants. In limited 
cases, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor approach. 
Advertising
Costs to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising 
are expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising expense totaled approximately $173 million, $179 million, 
and $188 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Page 84:
Restructuring
The Company's transformation programs include charges to approved restructuring plans. Restructuring 
charges include severance costs to eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate 
facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. These restructuring actions require 
management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce 
reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the 
value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs. The Company records restructuring charges based on 
estimated employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. The Company accrues for severance 
and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the 
amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, 
historical experiences and negotiated settlements. For a full description of the Company's restructuring actions, 
refer to the discussions in Note 3, “Transformation Programs.”
Taxes on Earnings
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in 
effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely 
than not to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future market 
growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the 
Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company were to determine 
that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the 
future, the Company would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings in 
the period in which such a determination was made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that the deferred tax 
assets are more likely than not to be realized, the Company would reverse the applicable portion of the previously 
recognized valuation allowance. In order for the Company to realize deferred tax assets, the Company must be able 
to generate sufficient taxable income, of the appropriate character, in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax 
assets are located, prior to their expiration under applicable tax laws.
The Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes that it is not more 
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical 
merits of the position. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions 
as well as any related interest and penalties. The Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements 
and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings.
The Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax in the U.S. The Company 
elected to treat taxes on future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts Receivable
The allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable is comprised of a general reserve and 
a specific reserve. The Company may record a specific reserve for individual accounts when the Company 
becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the 
customer's operating results or financial position. If there are additional changes in circumstances related to the 
specific customer, the Company further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. The Company 
maintains an allowance for credit losses for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of 
third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, 
the financial condition of customers and the length of time receivables are past due. These qualitative factors are 
subjective and require a degree of management judgment. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is 
based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. The Company establishes an allowance for expected 
credit losses related to accounts receivable, including unbilled receivables.

Page 85:
Financing Receivable
The allowance for expected credit losses related to financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve 
and a specific reserve. The Company establishes a specific reserve for financing receivables with identified 
exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely the Company will recover its 
investment. For individually evaluated receivables, the Company determines the expected cash flow for the 
receivable, which includes consideration of estimated proceeds from disposition of the collateral and calculates an 
estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts where a loss is considered probable, 
the Company records a specific reserve. The Company maintains a general reserve using a credit loss model on a 
regional basis and bases such percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and 
portfolio delinquencies, trends in the overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic 
conditions, and forward-looking information, including reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company 
excludes accounts evaluated as part of the specific reserve from the general reserve analysis. The Company 
generally writes off a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due, or 
sooner if the Company determines that the receivable is not collectible.
Non-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables
The Company considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not received by 
the contractually specified due date. The Company generally places financing receivables on non-accrual status, 
which is the suspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be non-performing at the earlier of 
the time at which full payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the receivable becomes 90 days past 
due. Subsequently, the Company may recognize revenue on non-accrual financing receivables as payments are 
received, which is on a cash basis, if the Company deems the recorded financing receivable to be fully collectible; 
however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of the recorded financing receivable, all cash receipts 
are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable, which is the cost recovery method. In certain 
circumstances, such as when the Company deems a delinquency to be of an administrative nature, financing 
receivables may accrue interest after becoming 90 days past due. The non-accrual status of a financing receivable 
may not impact a customer's risk rating. After all of a customer's delinquent principal and interest balances are 
settled, the Company may return the related financing receivable to accrual status.
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist 
principally of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, receivables from trade customers and 
contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.
The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, derivatives, and certain 
other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in many different 
geographic regions, and the Company's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of 
its risk management processes, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these 
financial institutions. The Company has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial 
institutions. The Company utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency and interest 
rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a 
material loss. For more details on the collateral program, see Note 13, “Financial Instruments.”
Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from trade customers and financing receivables is generally 
diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across 
many different industries and geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial 
condition of its customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain 
circumstances. As of October 31, 2023  and 2022 no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the 
Company's receivable from trade customers and financing receivables.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash is included within Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets 
and is primarily related to cash received under the Company's collateral securities agreements for its derivative 
instruments and cash restricted under the fixed-term securitization program for the issuance of asset-backed debt 
securities.

Inventory
The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard 
cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. At each reporting period, the Company assesses 
the value of its inventory and writes down the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required, for estimated 
excess or obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in future demand forecasts, market 
conditions, technological changes, product life-cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product 
pricing, physical deterioration, and quality issues. The write down for excess or obsolescence is charged to the 
provision of inventory, which is a component of Cost of Products and Cost of Services in the Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, 
and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly 
established cost basis.
Property, Plant and Equipment, net
The Company states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company 
capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense 
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are five to 
40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. The Company 
depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. The Company 
depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. 
The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer services contract generally do not exceed 
the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation 
are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings.
The Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use 
software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and installation and testing of the 
software. The Company amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives of the software, generally from three to five years.
Leases
Lessee Accounting
The Company enters into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, 
vehicles, and aviation. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement contains 
a lease when the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset over the lease term. Upon 
lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and right-of-
use (“ROU”) asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The lease liability is measured at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments not yet paid 
over the lease term and the Company's incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company's leases do not 
provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which the 
Company would borrow, on a secured basis, in the country where the lease was executed. The ROU asset is based 
on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, and the lessee's initial direct costs. 
Fixed payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets and liabilities, while non-lease components, such as 
maintenance or utility charges are expensed as incurred. The Company has agreements with lease and non-lease 
components that are accounted for separately and not included in its leased assets and corresponding liabilities for 
the majority of the Company's lease agreements. The Company allocates consideration to the lease and non-lease 
components using their relative standalone values. The lease term may include options to extend or to terminate the 
lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company has elected not to record leases with an 
initial term of twelve months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For finance leases, the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the 
asset or the lease term. Interest expense on the lease liability is recorded separately using the interest method. For 
operating leases, lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Lessor Accounting
The Company's lease offerings are non-cancelable and the payment schedule primarily consists of fixed 
payments. Variable payments that are based on an index are included in lease receivables. The Company allocates 
consideration amongst lease components and non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis, 
when lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations. At the end of the lease term, the Company 
allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment or renew the lease based on mutually 
agreed upon terms. 
The Company retains a residual position in equipment through lease and finance agreements which is 
equivalent to an estimated market value. The residual amount is established prior to lease inception, based upon 
estimated equipment values at end of lease using product road map trends, historical analysis, future projections 
and remarketing experience. The Company's residual amounts are evaluated at least annually to assess the 
appropriateness of the carrying values. Any anticipated declines in specific future residual values that are 
considered to be other-than-temporary would be recorded in current earnings. The Company is able to optimize the 
recovery of residual values by selling equipment in place, extending lease arrangements on a fixed term basis, 
entering into a monthly usage rental term beyond the initial lease term, and selling lease returned equipment in the 
secondary market. The contractual lease agreement also identifies return conditions that ensures the leased 
equipment will be in good operating condition upon return minus any normal wear and tear. During the residual 
review process, product changes, product updates, as well as market conditions are reviewed and adjustments if 
other than temporary are made to residual values in accordance with the impact of any such changes. The 
remarketing sales organization closely manages the sale of equipment lease returns to optimize the recovery of 
outstanding residual by product. 
Business Combinations
The Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in the Company's consolidated results 
prospectively from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the 
assets acquired including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling 
interests in the acquired entity based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair 
value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. The excess of the fair 
value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling 
interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of 
the synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the value of the acquired assembled 
workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and post-
acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as 
incurred.
Goodwill
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the 
Company has the option to first perform a qualitative test to determine whether further impairment testing is 
necessary or to perform a qualitative assessment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying 
amount. Under the qualitative assessment, the Company is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
unless it determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying 
amount. Qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic and industry environment as well as 
Company-specific factors.  The Company used the qualitative assessment for the Athonet and OpsRamp reporting 
units.  For, all other reporting units, the Company elects to perform a quantitative test as part of its annual goodwill 
impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
In the quantitative assessment, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of 
fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach with 
the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived solely from the market approach. Under 
the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of 
estimated future cash flows covering discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations. The 
Company prepares cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating 
margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The Company bases the discount rate on the 
weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and

the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market 
approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from 
comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. 
The Company weights the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of 
comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not 
meaningful or not available, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income 
approach.
If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting 
unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its 
carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting 
unit's carrying value over its fair value (not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit).
Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives, long-lived assets and ROU assets for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For 
lease assets such circumstances would include a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset, or 
subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated lease. The Company assesses the recoverability of 
assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual 
disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is 
impaired. The Company measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, as the difference between the carrying 
amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market 
approach. The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the 
estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to ten years. Intangible assets purchased as part of an 
acquisition are included in Intangible assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All other separately 
purchased intangible assets are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets.
Equity Method Investments
Investments and ownership interests are accounted for under equity method accounting if the Company has 
the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company records 
its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses 
on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within Earnings from equity interests in the 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with its equity method investees 
are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of 
the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives 
of the related assets that gave rise to them. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; 
instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment. The Company records its interest in the net earnings 
of its equity method investments based on the most recently available financial statements of the investees. 
The carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect the Company's interest in net 
earnings, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments. The Company reviews for impairment 
whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the 
decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Equity Securities Investments
Equity securities investments with readily determinable fair values (other than those accounted for under the 
equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value and any changes in 
fair value are recognized in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For equity 
investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company may elect to apply the measurement alternative 
or the fair value option. Under the measurement alternative investments are measured at cost, less impairment, and 
adjusted for qualifying observable price changes on a prospective basis. The Company reviews for impairment at 
each reporting period, assessing factors such as deterioration of earnings, adverse change in market/industry 
conditions, the ability to operate as a going concern, and other factors which indicate that the carrying amount of the 
investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the 
impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company elects the fair value option when it 
believes that it best reflects the underlying economics of the investment. These investments may be valued using

third-party pricing services at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Interest 
and other, net  in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Debt Securities Investments
Debt securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains 
and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the specific identification 
method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company monitors 
its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis. When the carrying amount of an investment in 
debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be due to credit-related factors, the 
Company recognizes the impairment using an allowance for credit loss in Interest and other, net, in the 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings, while the impairment that is not credit related is recorded in Accumulated 
other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivatives
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and, at times, options, to 
manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company 
does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  
The Company receives fair value to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. When prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset 
or liability, the Company generally uses industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of derivative 
positions. Such measurements involve projecting future cash flows and discounting the future amounts to present 
value using market based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, Company and counterparty credit risk, 
foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices. In the absence of such data, the Company will use 
internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that 
occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about 
assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, 
identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then 
making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability 
being valued.
For a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 12, “Fair Value” 
and Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” respectively.
Contingencies
The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary 
course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a 
liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not record 
gain contingencies until realized. See Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies,” for a full description of the Company's 
contingencies.
Warranties
The Company accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of recognizing revenue. The 
Company's standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a 
product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. The Company engages in extensive product quality 
programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. The 
estimated warranty obligation is based on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost 
per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure 
outside of the Company's baseline experience. Warranty terms generally range from one to five years for parts and 
labor, depending upon the product. For certain networking products, the Company offers a lifetime warranty. Over 
the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately 1.1% of annual net product 
revenue. Refer to Note 18, “Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties” for additional information.

Recently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements
Although there are new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(“FASB”) that the Company will adopt, as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting 
pronouncements will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable 
segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable 
segment’s expenses. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, though early 
adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to provide disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate 
reconciliation and income taxes paid. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 
2026, though early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 2: Segment Information
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's operations are organized into six segments for financial reporting purposes: 
Compute, High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence (“HPC & AI”), Storage, Intelligent Edge, Financial 
Services (“FS”), and Corporate Investments and Other. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is 
based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), who is the Chief Executive Officer 
(“CEO”), uses to evaluate, view and run the Company's business operations, which include, but are not limited to,

Segment Policy
Hewlett Packard Enterprise derives the results of its business segments directly from its internal management 
reporting system. The accounting policies that Hewlett Packard Enterprise uses to derive segment results are 
substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. The CODM measures the performance of each 
segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. The CODM uses these results, in part, to 
evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to each of the segments.
Segment revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that reflect 
transactions between the segments on an arm's-length basis. Intersegment revenues primarily consist of sales of 
hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as operating 
leases by FS to the Company's customers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's consolidated net revenue is derived and 
reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.
Financing cost in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on borrowing and 
funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries, and debt issued by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for 
which a portion of the proceeds benefited FS.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at 
the corporate level. These unallocated operating costs include certain corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based 
compensation expense, amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, 
transformation costs, disaster charges and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. 
Effective November 1, 2023, in order to align the Company’s segment financial reporting more closely with its 
current business structure, the Company established a new reportable segment, Hybrid Cloud which includes its 
historical Storage segment, HPE GreenLake Flex Solutions (which provides flexible as-a-service IT infrastructure 
through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and was previously reported under Compute and HPC & AI 
segments), Private Cloud, and Software (previously reported under Corporate Investments and Other segment). 
Additionally, certain products and services reported in the financial results for the HPC & AI segment through the 
end of fiscal 2023 will be reported in the Compute and Hybrid Cloud segments, and the recently acquired Athonet 
business and certain components of the CMS business reported in the financial results for Corporate Investments

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 
Defined Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans worldwide, the most significant of which are the United 
Kingdom (“UK”) and Germany plans. The pension plan in the UK is closed to new entrants, however, members 
continue to earn benefit accruals. This plan provides benefits based on final pay and years of service and generally 
requires contributions from members. The German pension program that is open to new hires consists of cash 
balance plans that provide employer credits as a percentage of pay, certain employee pay deferrals and employer 
matching contributions. There also are previously closed German pension programs that include cash balance and 
final average pay plans. These previously closed pension programs comprise the majority of the pension obligations 
in Germany. 
Post-Retirement Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, the most significant of which is in the U.S. 
Generally, employees hired before August 2008 are eligible for employer credits under the Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (“RMSA”) upon attaining age 45. Employer credits to the 
RMSA available after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made 
to a voluntary employee beneficiary association. Upon retirement, employees may use these employer credits for 
the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses.
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Company’s 
defined contribution expense was approximately $206 million, $196 million and $170 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) 
Plan (“HPE 401(k) Plan”), when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. The HPE 401(k) 
Plan’s quarterly employer matching contributions are 100% of an employee’s contributions, up to a maximum of 4% 
of eligible compensation. 
Pension Benefit Expense
The Company's net pension and post-retirement benefit costs that were directly attributable to the eligible 
employees, retirees and other former employees of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and recognized in the Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the table below.

(1) The average assumed interest credited for HPE's cash balance plans and postretirement plans, as applicable.
To estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit plans that 
use the yield curve approach, which represent substantially all of the Company's defined benefit plans, the 
Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by 
applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the 
relevant projected cash flows.

For the year ended October 31, 2023, the benefit obligation decreased from $9.5 billion to $9.4 billion primarily 
due to the effects of increasing discount rates and payments of benefits reducing the obligation offset by the interest 
on the benefit obligation along with the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Pension assets remained flat at $9.9 billion as 
the reduction due to less than expected asset returns and benefits paid from plan assets was partially offset by the 
weakening of the U.S. dollar.

(1) Repurchase agreements, primarily in the UK, represent the plans’ short-term borrowing to hedge against interest rate and 
inflation risks. Investments in approximately $2.3 billion and $3.0 billion of government bonds collateralize this short-term 
borrowing at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The plans have an obligation to return the cash after the term of the 
agreements. Due to the short-term nature of the agreements, the outstanding balance of the obligation approximates fair 
value.
(2) Includes funds that invest primarily in asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, 
and/or private debt investments. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and 
broker quotes and/or 3rd party pricing services. Significant unobservable inputs include yields which are determined by 
considering the market yield of comparable public debt instruments adjusted for estimated losses to reflect where the 
expected recovery rate would be less than 100%, discount rates, and internal rate of return (IRR). The yields ranged from 
6% to 22%, with the weighted average around 10%. In the prior year, the yields ranged from 4% to 18%, with the weighted 
average around 7%. The discount rates ranged from 4% to 5%, with the weighted average around 4%. In the prior year, the 
discount rates ranged from 1% to 5%, with the weighted average around 3%. The IRR ranged from 5% to 21%, with the 
main weighted average around 10%. In the prior year, the IRR ranged from 4% to 11%, with the main weighted average 
around 8%. Generally, an increase in yield and discounted rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain 
investments.

(3) Includes funds, primarily in the UK, that invest in both private and public equities, as well as emerging markets across all 
sectors. The funds also hold fixed income and derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and inflation risk. In addition, the 
funds include units in transferable securities, collective investment schemes, money market funds, asset-backed income, 
cash, and deposits. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and book value or 
net asset value. Significant unobservable inputs include discount rates. The discount rates ranged from 3% to 28%, with the 
weighted average around 14%. In the prior year, the discount rates ranged from 3% to 30%, with the weighted average 
around 12%. Generally, an increase in discount rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.
(4) Includes a pooled fund in the UK, that seeks a rate of return with direct or indirect linkage to UK inflation by investing in 
vehicles including bonds, long lease property, income strips, asset-backed securities, and index linked assets. Units are 
available for subscription on the first business day of each calendar month at net asset value. There are no redemption 
restrictions or future commitments on these investments. 
(5) Common Contractual Funds (“CCFs”) are investment arrangements in which institutional investors pool their assets. Units 
may be acquired in four different sub-funds focused on equities, fixed income, alternative investments, and emerging 
markets. Each sub-fund is invested in accordance with the fund's investment objective and units are issued in relation to 
each sub-fund. While the sub-funds are not publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value either once or twice a 
month, depending on the sub-fund. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.
(6) Includes funds, primarily in Germany, that invest in a diversified portfolio of European real estate assets exposed to logistics 
real estate properties, food retailing properties, residential and commercial properties, and properties under development. 
Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include the income capitalization approach and cost approach. 
Significant unobservable inputs include rental yield and IRR. The rental yield rates ranged from 4% to 6%, with the weighted 
average around 4%. In the prior year, the rental yield rates ranged from 3% to 6%, with the weighted average around 4%. 
The IRR ranged from 5% to 8%, with the main weighted average around 7%. In the prior year, the IRR ranged from 4% to 
7%, with the main weighted average around 6%. Generally, an increase in rental yield rates may result in a decrease in the 
fair value of certain investments.
(7) Includes life insurance investment policies, unsettled transactions, and derivative instruments. As of October 31, 2023, the 
derivative instruments include synthetic equity swaps held by the UK plans with equity exposure of $272 million.
As of October 31, 2023 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $68 million were invested in publicly traded 
registered investment entities of which $55 million are classified within Level 1 and $13 million within Level 2 of the 
fair value hierarchy. As of October 31, 2022 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $60 million were invested in 
publicly traded registered investment entities of which $48 million are classified within Level 1 and $12 million within 
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value. 
Investments in publicly traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as 
reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. For corporate, government backed 
debt securities, and some other investments, fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market 
transactions. The valuation of certain real estate funds, insurance group annuity contracts and alternative 
investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment and 
involves a level of uncertainty. The valuation is generally based on fair value as reported by the asset manager and 
adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by 
management, including, but are not limited to, the timeliness of fair value as reported by the asset manager and 
changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last fair value reported by the asset 
manager. The use of different techniques or assumptions to estimate fair value could result in a different fair value 
measurement at the reporting date. Cash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued 
based on cost, which approximates fair value. Other than those assets that have quoted prices from an active 
market, investments are generally classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety. Investments measured using net asset value as 
a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.
Plan Asset Allocations 
The weighted-average target and actual asset allocations across the benefit plans at the respective 
measurement dates for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans were as follows:
 Defined Benefit Plans
  Plan Assets
2023 Target

For the Company's post-retirement benefit plans, approximately 81% of the plan assets are invested in cash 
and cash equivalents and approximately 19% in multi-asset credit investments which consists primarily of 
investment grade credit, emerging market debt and high yield bonds.
Investment Policy
The Company's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of 
risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the 
plans’ investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the 
broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and 
investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans’ investment 
managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and the Company may utilize 
derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures.
Asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. 
Investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In 
some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of 
investment in fixed income securities than would otherwise be deployed. The Company reviews the investment 
strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on 
asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees or investment committees for the specific 
plan.
Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class 
in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the 
current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns, which considers 
each country’s specific inflation outlook. Because the Company’s investment policy is to employ primarily active 
investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted to reflect the 
expected additional returns, net of fees.
Employer Contributions and Funding Policy
During fiscal 2023, the Company contributed approximately $179 million to its non-U.S. pension plans and 
paid $6 million to cover benefit claims under the Company’s post-retirement benefit plans.
During fiscal 2024, the Company expects to contribute approximately $182 million to its non-U.S. pension 
plans and an additional $3 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. In addition, the 
Company expects to pay approximately $8 million to cover benefit claims for its post-retirement benefit plans. The 
Company's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by various 
authorities including local government and taxing authorities.
Estimated Future Benefits Payments
As of October 31, 2023, estimated future benefits payments for the Company's retirement plans were as

Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation
On April 14, 2021 (the “Approval Date”), shareholders of the Company approved the Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise Company 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) that replaced the Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive 
Plan (the “2015 Plan”). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of various types of awards including restricted stock 
awards, stock options and performance-based awards. These awards generally vest over 3 years from the grant 
date. The maximum number of shares as of the Approval Date that may be delivered to the participants under the 
2021 Plan shall not exceed 7 million shares, plus 35.8 million shares that were available for grant under the 2015 
Plan and any awards granted under the 2015 Plan prior to the Approval Date that were cash-settled, forfeited, 
terminated, or lapsed after the Approval Date. On April 5, 2022, shareholders of the Company approved an 
amendment to the 2021 Plan thereby increasing the overall number of shares available for issuance by 15 million 
shares. As of October 31, 2023, the Company had remaining authorization of 35.9 million shares under the 2021 
Plan. 
Stock-Based Compensation Expense

Stock-based compensation expense $ 428 $ 391 $ 382 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Effective November 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2015 Employee 
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The total number of shares of Company's common stock authorized under the 
ESPP was 80 million. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their eligible compensation to 
purchase Hewlett Packard Enterprise's common stock. The ESPP provides for a discount not to exceed 15% and 
an offering period up to 24 months. The Company currently offers 6-month offering periods during which employees 
have the ability to purchase shares at 95% of the closing market price on the purchase date. No stock-based 
compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases, as the criteria of a non-compensatory 
plan were met.
Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. 
Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock 
units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The fair value of the restricted stock units is the closing 
price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company expenses the fair value of 
restricted stock units ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.

Forfeited/canceled  (3,128)  15 
Outstanding at end of year  54,389 $ 15 
The total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested for Company employees in fiscal 2023, 2022, 
and 2021 was $319 million, $262 million and $271 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2023, there was $325 
million of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units, which 
the Company expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.3 years.
Performance Restricted Units 
 The Company issues performance stock units (“PSU”) that vest on the satisfaction of service and 
performance conditions. The fair value of the PSUs is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the 
grant date of the award. The Company also issues performance-adjusted restricted stock units (“PARSU”) that vest 
only on the satisfaction of service, performance and market conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of 
PARSUs subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The 
expenses associated with these performance restricted units were not material for any of the periods presented.
Stock Options
Stock options granted under the Plan are generally non-qualified stock options, but the Plan permits some 
options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The exercise price of a 
stock option is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the option grant date. The majority of 
the stock options issued by the Company contain only service vesting conditions. The Company has also issued 
performance-contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions. The 
Company did not issue stock options in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Stock options assumed through acquisitions were not 
material for fiscal 2023. The expenses associated with stock options were not material for any of the periods 
presented. 
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock 
options subject to service-based vesting conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options subject 
to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice 
model, as these awards contain market conditions.

The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on the Company's effective tax 
rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.
In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded $131 million of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete 
to the year. These amounts primarily included $104 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, 
and acquisition, disposition and other related charges and $19 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-
based compensation.
In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $454 million of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete 
to the year. These amounts primarily included $150 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign 
valuation allowances, $99 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition 
and other related charges, $43 million of income tax benefits related to the settlement of U.S. tax audit matters, $42 
million of income tax benefits related to the release of U.S. passive foreign tax credit valuation allowances, $30 
million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the 
Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc., $27 
million of income tax benefits related to the utilization of capital losses which had a full valuation allowance, $12 
million of income tax benefits as a result of the fiscal 2021 U.S. tax return filing primarily from the decrease in GILTI, 
and $11 million of net income tax benefits related to settlements and ongoing discussions in foreign tax audit 
matters.

In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded $294 million of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete 
to the year. These amounts primarily included $180 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, 
and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $157 million of income tax benefits related to releases of 
foreign valuation allowances, $39 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes, and 
$32 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the 
Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc. 
These benefits were partially offset by $337 million of net income tax charges associated with income from the 
Itanium litigation judgment, against which $244 million of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation 
allowance were utilized, resulting in a net tax expense of $93 million.
As a result of certain employment actions and capital investments the Company has undertaken, income from 
manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates through 2039. The gross foreign 
income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were $857 million ($0.65 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 
2023, $832 million ($0.63 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2022, and $889 million ($0.67 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2021. 
Refer to Note 16, “Net Earnings Per Share” for details on shares used to compute diluted net EPS.

Balance at end of year $ 672 $ 674 $ 2,131 
Up to $354 million, $386 million and $688 million of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, would affect its effective tax rate if realized in their respective periods. During 
the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company effectively settled with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for 
fiscal 2016, primarily contributing to the reduction in the Company's unrecognized tax benefits of $1.5 billion, which 
was predominantly related to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition which does not affect the 
Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties 
accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings . The 
Company recognized $25 million and $55 million of interest income and $17 million of interest expense in fiscal 
2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had accrued $56 million and 
$81 million, respectively, for interest and penalties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately 85 other countries and is subject to 
routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.
The Company engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters 
in various jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax audits for years prior to 2017. The IRS 
is conducting audits of the Company's fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income tax returns. During the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments (“NOPAs”) for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 
relating to HPE’s intercompany transfer pricing. After the close of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Page 108:
Report (“RAR”) finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal years. The IRS is seeking 
to increase taxable income across the three fiscal years by $904 million. As of the balance sheet date, HPE has 
sufficient tax credit carryforwards to offset any incremental tax liability from the adjustments in the RAR. However, 
HPE disagrees with the IRS’ adjustments and believes the positions taken on its tax returns are more likely than not 
to prevail on technical merits, and the Company will defend these positions through the IRS administrative 
processes, as necessary. Accordingly, no changes have been made to the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax 
positions in fiscal 2023 relating to the IRS’ adjustments. With respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, the 
Company is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 2005. However, it is reasonably 
possible that certain foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next 12 months, including issues 
involving resolution of certain intercompany transactions and other matters. The Company believes it is reasonably 
possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an amount up to $16 million within the next 
12 months.
The Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits 
that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of 
these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of the Company's tax provision. The Company adjusts its 
uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other 
information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and 
there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts 
ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the 
Provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could 
have a material impact on net earnings or cash flows.
The Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income and foreign withholding taxes on $9.4 billion 
of undistributed earnings and basis differences from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2023  because the 
Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of 
unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings and basis differences is not practicable. The Company 
will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and 
foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and the Company determines 
that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.
Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities 
recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.

Financing Receivables
Financing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases of the Company and third-party 
products. These receivables typically have terms ranging from two to five years and are usually collateralized by a 
security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from operating 
leases. The allowance for credit losses represents future expected credit losses over the life of the receivables 
based on past experience, current information and forward-looking economic considerations. The components of 
financing receivables were as follows:

The Company entered into arrangements to transfer the contractual payments due under certain financing 
receivables to third party financial institutions. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023  and 2022, the 
Company sold $237 million and $183 million, respectively, of financing receivables. 
Credit Quality Indicators
Due to the homogeneous nature of its leasing transactions, the Company manages its financing receivables 
on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large 
number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries 
and geographic regions. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that 
credit quality over the term of a transaction. The Company assigns risk ratings to each lease based on the 
creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular 
transaction and periodically updates the risk ratings when there is a change in the underlying credit quality. Such 
variables include the underlying value and liquidity of the collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of 
the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.
The credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2023, 
presented on an amortized cost basis by year of origination was as follows:

Accounts rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB– or higher, while 
accounts rated moderate risk generally have the equivalent of BB+ or lower. The Company classifies accounts as 
high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes there is a 
significant near-term risk of impairment. The credit quality indicators do not reflect any mitigation actions taken to 
transfer credit risk to third parties.

Variable Interest Entities
The Company has issued asset-backed debt securities under a fixed-term securitization program to private 
investors. The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized by the U.S. fixed-term financing receivables and 
leased equipment in the offering, which is held by a Special Purpose Entity (“SPE”). The SPE meets the definition of 
a VIE and is consolidated, along with the associated debt, into the Consolidated Financial Statements as the 
Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The SPE is a bankruptcy-remote legal entity with separate assets 
and liabilities. The purpose of the SPE is to facilitate the funding of customer receivables and leased equipment in 
the capital markets.  
The Company's risk of loss related to securitized receivables and leased equipment is limited to the amount by 
which the Company's right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, 
principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities. 
The following table presents the assets and liabilities held by the consolidated VIE as of October 31, 2023 and 
2022, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The assets in the table below include those that can 
be used to settle the obligations of the VIE. Additionally, general creditors do not have recourse to the assets of the

are subject to change within the measurement period. Measurement period adjustments are recorded in the 
reporting period in which the estimates are finalized and adjustment amounts are determined.
The pro forma results of operations, revenue and net income subsequent to the acquisition dates have not 
been presented as they are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations, either individually or in 
the aggregate. Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible 
assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.

company that monitors, observes, automates, and manages IT infrastructure, cloud resources, workloads, and 
applications for hybrid and multi-cloud environments, including the leading hyperscalers. OpsRamp’s results of 
operations were included within the Corporate Investments and Other segment. The acquisition date fair value 
consideration of $307 million primarily consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock. In connection with this 
acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $217 million of goodwill, and $84 million of intangible assets. The 
Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life 
of 5 years.
On March 15, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Axis Security, a cloud security provider,

(1) Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment losses of $1.9 billion. Of this amount, $1.7 billion relates to HPC & AI of which 
$815 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Software reporting unit within Corporate Investments 
and Other, has an accumulated impairment loss of $90 million which was also recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2022.
(2) As a result of the organizational realignments which were effective as of November 1, 2022, (described in Note 1, "Overview 
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"), $160 million of goodwill was reallocated from the Storage segment to the 
Compute segment as of the beginning of the period using a relative fair value approach.
Goodwill Impairments
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, at the reporting unit level. As 
of October 31, 2023 , the Company's reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments 
identified in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of 
Corporate Investments and Other which contains five reporting units: A & PS, Athonet, legacy CMS, OpsRamp, and 
Software. 
The Company’s fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairment. The excess 
of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 5% to 218% of the respective 
carrying amounts.
The Compute reporting unit has goodwill of $7.7 billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over 
carrying value of 5% as of the annual test date. The Compute business is facing challenges reflected in the results 
for October 31, 2023. The Compute business is cyclical in nature. Over the last several years, digital transformation 
drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, in the current macroeconomic and inflationary 
environment, customers have slowed their investments resulting in lower server demand and competitive pricing. 
These dynamics are further compounded by higher supply chain costs. During this cycle, the Compute business 
continues to focus on capturing market share while maintaining operating margin.
The HPC & AI reporting unit has goodwill of $2.9 billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over 
carrying value of 12% as of the annual test date. The HPC & AI business continues to face challenges related to 
supply chain constraints of key components and other operational challenges impacting our ability to achieve 
certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated 
with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. We currently believe these challenges will be 
successfully addressed as the supply chain constraints continue to improve.

The Company’s fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill 
related to the HPC & AI and Software reporting units. There was no impairment of goodwill for our other reporting 
units.  
The decline in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit below its carrying value resulted from changes in 
expected future cash flows due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational challenges as 
well as an increase in cost of capital. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $815 million was recorded in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.
The decline in the fair value of the Software reporting unit resulted primarily from a decline in market multiples. 
As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $90 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.
Based on the results of the Company's interim and annual impairment tests in fiscal 2021, the Company 
determined that no impairment of goodwill existed.

Note 12: Fair Value
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit 
price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. 
Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the 
assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information 
available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value 
hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar 
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable 
for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable 
inputs. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no transfers between levels within the fair 
value hierarchy.
The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring 
basis:

Valuation Techniques
Cash Equivalents and Investments: The Company holds time deposits, money market funds, debt securities 
primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds. The Company values cash equivalents 
using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market 
observable inputs. The fair value of debt and equity investments was based on quoted market prices or model-
driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain 
instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data. 
Equity and other securities include investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. In evaluating non-
marketable securities for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses valuation techniques using 
the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash 
flow projections. 
Derivative Instruments: The Company uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps to hedge 
certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company uses industry standard valuation models to 
measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to 
present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, the Company and 
counterparties' credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest 
rates. See Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” for a further discussion of the Company's use of derivative instruments.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
  Short-Term and Long-Term Debt: T he Company estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an 
expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently 
available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its own 
credit risk. The portion of the Company's debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an 
amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the 
hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. As of October 31, 2023, the estimated 
fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $12.2 billion and the carrying value was $12.4 billion. 
As of October 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $12.2 billion 
and the carrying value was $12.5 billion. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short-term 
and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Other Financial Instruments: For the balance of the Company's financial instruments, primarily accounts 
receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts 
approximate fair value due to their short nature. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these 
other financial instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements
Equity Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Value: Equity Investments are recorded at cost and 
measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price 
changes. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a net unrealized loss of $45 million and $17 million, 
respectively, which included impairments of $50 million and $24 million for the same respective periods. For fiscal 
2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $64 million and no impairment charges on these investments. 
These amounts are reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. If measured at 
fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. These adjustments are based on observable price changes for certain equity investments without readily 
determinable fair value. For investments still held as of October 31, 2023, the cumulative upward adjustments for 
observable price changes was $33 million and cumulative downward adjustments for observable price changes and 
impairments was $72 million . Refer to Note 13 “Financial Instruments,” for further information about equity 
investments.
Non-Financial Assets: The Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, 
plant and equipment, are recorded at cost. The Company records ROU assets based on the lease liability, adjusted 
for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fair value adjustments are 
made to these non-financial assets in the period an impairment charge is recognized.

In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a ROU asset impairment charge of $18 million, 
$5 million and $89 million, respectively, in Transformation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as the 
carrying value of certain ROU assets exceeded its fair value. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $905 million 
associated with the HPC & AI reporting unit and the Software reporting unit within the Corporate Investments and 
Other segment. The fair value of the Company's reporting units was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 
due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. For more information 
on the goodwill impairment, see Note 11, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets.”

The carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement 
alternative was $145 million and $175 million as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2023 and 
2022, the Company recorded a net unrealized loss of $45 million and $17 million, respectively, which included 
impairments of $50 million and $24 million for the same respective periods. For fiscal 2021, the Company recorded 
an unrealized gain of  $64 million and no impairment charges on these investments. 
The carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the fair value option 
was $135 million and $126 million as of October 31, 2023  and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the 
Company recorded net unrealized gains of $9 million and $86 million, respectively, on these investments. In fiscal 
2022, the Company sold $165 million of these investments.
Derivative Instruments
The Company is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate 
changes in the normal course of its business. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative 
instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign 
currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. The Company's objective is to offset gains and 
losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, 
thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. The Company does not 
have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company may 
designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency 
exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment hedges”). Additionally, for derivatives not 
designated as hedging instruments, the Company categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. 
Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in fair value of 
the derivative instruments is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Consolidated Statements of 
Comprehensive Income depending upon the type of hedge as further discussed below. The Company classifies 
cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
As a result of its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will 
fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only 
entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and 
other factors, and the Company maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institution's credit rating 
and other factors. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include reviewing 
and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties. 
Master netting agreements also mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting the Company to net 
amounts due from the Company to a counterparty against amounts due to the Company from the same 
counterparty under certain conditions.
To further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, the Company has collateral security agreements, which 
allows the Company to hold collateral from, or require the Company to post collateral to counterparties when 
aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit 
ratings of the Company and its counterparties. If the Company's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the 
counterparty has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Conversely, if the 
counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the Company has the right to request full 
collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Collateral is generally posted within two business days. The 
fair value of the Company's derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $108 million and 
$106 million at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, most of which were fully collateralized within two business 
days.
Under the Company's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a 
covered change of control event affecting the Company that results in the surviving entity being rated below a 
specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect the Company's financial position or cash flows 
as of October 31, 2023 and 2022.
Fair Value Hedges
The Company issues long-term debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. The 
Company may enter into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Page 127:
to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based 
floating interest rate which was replaced with SOFR starting in July of fiscal 2023. The swap transactions generally 
involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, the Company may 
choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a 
larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments, the Company may 
enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may 
designate these swaps as fair value hedges.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the 
change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged 
item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency 
exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, 
and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's foreign currency cash 
flow hedges mature generally within twelve months; however, forward contracts associated with sales-type and 
direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which can extend 
up to five years.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, and as long as they remain 
highly effective, the Company records the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in Accumulated other 
comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently 
reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the same financial statement line item when the hedged transaction is 
recognized. 
Net Investment Hedges
The Company uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in 
certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. The Company records the changes in 
the fair value of the hedged items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of equity in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge 
foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. The Company also uses total return swaps, based on 
equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability.
For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes changes in fair 
value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest 
and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.
Hedge Effectiveness
For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by 
offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged items with the change in fair value of the derivative. For forward 
contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by 
comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the 
hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates.

Offsetting of Derivative Instruments
The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
Company's derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements. 
The Company does not offset the fair value of its derivative instruments against the fair value of cash collateral 
posted under collateral security agreements. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, information related to the potential 
effect of the Company's use of the master netting agreements and collateral security agreements was as follows:

respectively, of borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries that are collateralized by 
receivables and underlying assets associated with the related finance and operating leases. For both the periods presented, 
the carrying amount of the assets approximated the carrying amount of the borrowings.

As disclosed in Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” the Company used interest rate swaps to mitigate the 
exposure of its fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the 
variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with its variable-rate debt. Interest rates on long-term 
debt in the table above have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any interest rate swaps.
Commercial Paper
 Hewlett Packard Enterprise maintains two commercial paper programs, “the Parent Programs,” and a wholly-
owned subsidiary maintains a third program. The Parent Program in the U.S. provides for the issuance of U.S. 
dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $4.75 billion. The Parent 
Program outside the U.S. provides for the issuance of commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or 
British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative 
currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those two programs 
at any one time cannot exceed the $4.75 billion as authorized by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Board of Directors. In 
addition, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise subsidiary's euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Program 
provides for the issuance of commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal 
amount of $1.0 billion. As of October 31, 2023  and 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the Parent 
Programs. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, $679 million and $542 million, respectively, were outstanding under 
the subsidiary’s program.
Revolving Credit Facility
The Company maintains a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was entered into in December 2021, 
with an aggregate lending commitment of $4.75 billion for a period of five years. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, 
no borrowings were outstanding under either credit facility.
Uncommitted Credit facility
On September 21, 2023, the Company entered into a five-year agreement with Societe Generale for an 
uncommitted short-term cash advance facility in the principal amount of up to $500 million. As of October 31, 2023, 
no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility.

Dividends
The stockholders of HPE common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by HPE's 
Board of Directors. Dividends declared were $0.48 per common share in both fiscal 2023 and 2022.
On November 28, 2023, the Company declared a regular cash dividend of $0.13 per share on the Company's 
common stock, payable on January 11, 2024, to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on 
December 13, 2023.
Share Repurchase Program
On October 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with a $3.0 
billion authorization, which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of $3.0 billion, $5.0 billion 
and $2.5 billion on May 24, 2016, October 16, 2017 and February 21, 2018, respectively. This program, which does 
not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. 
In fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased and settled a total of 27.2 million shares under its share repurchase 
program through open market repurchases, which included 0.3 million shares that were unsettled open market 
repurchases as of October 31, 2022.  Additionally, the Company had unsettled open market repurchases of 
0.2 million  shares as of October 31, 2023. Shares repurchased during the fiscal 2023 were recorded as a 
$0.4 billion reduction to stockholders' equity. As of October 31, 2023, the Company had a remaining authorization of 
approximately $1.0 billion for future share repurchases. 
In fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased and settled a total of 35.4 million shares under its share repurchase 
program through open market repurchases, which included 0.8 million shares that were unsettled open market 
repurchases as of October 31, 2021.  Additionally, the Company had unsettled open market repurchases of 
0.3 million shares as of October 31, 2022. Shares repurchased during the fiscal 2022 were recorded as a $0.5 
billion reduction to stockholders' equity.
Note 16: Net Earnings Per Share
The Company calculates basic net EPS using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares 
outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net EPS includes the weighted-average dilutive effect of outstanding 
restricted stock units, stock options, and performance-based awards.

presented.
Note 17: Litigation and Contingencies
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including 
those consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits, and environmental 
matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as part of the Separation and Distribution 
Agreement (the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”) entered into in connection with Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise’s spin-off from HP Inc. (formerly known as “Hewlett-Packard Company”) (the “Separation”), Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related 
to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreement included provisions that allocate liability and 
financial responsibility for pending litigation involving the parties, as well as provide for cross-indemnification of the 
parties against liabilities to one party arising out of liabilities allocated to the other party. The Separation and 
Distribution Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and 
future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the Separation. Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the 
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of 
having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reviews these 
matters at least quarterly and adjusts these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, 
advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Litigation is 
inherently unpredictable. However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal 
matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any 
particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has 
recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2023, it was not reasonably possible that 
a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in its 
financial statements.
Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations
Ross and Rogus v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.  On November 8, 2018, a putative class action 
complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara alleging that HPE pays its California-
based female employees “systemically lower compensation” than HPE pays male employees performing 
substantially similar work. The complaint alleges various California state law claims, including California’s Equal Pay 
Act, Fair Employment and Housing Act, and Unfair Competition Law, and seeks certification of a California-only 
class of female employees employed in certain “Covered Positions.” The parties subsequently reached an 
agreement to resolve this class action. The terms of the settlement are reflected in Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary

Page 136:
Approval of Class Action Settlement and Certification of Settlement Class, which was filed with the Court on 
September 26, 2022. On November 3, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion and preliminarily approved the 
terms of the class settlement, which defines the settlement class as all “[w]omen actively employed in California by 
Defendant at any point from November 1, 2015, through the date of Preliminary Approval” who were employed in a 
covered job code. The settlement class excludes certain individuals, including those who previously executed an 
arbitration agreement with HPE or an agreement that resulted in a release or waiver of claims. On April 28, 2023, 
the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of the Class Action Settlement and Certification of the 
Settlement Class. The Court has scheduled a compliance hearing for February 8, 2024, to assess the distribution of 
the settlement fund to the class members and resolve any final issues.
India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings.  On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence (the “DRI”) issued notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd (“HP India”), a subsidiary 
of HP Inc., seven HP India employees and one former HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs 
duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately 
$370 million, plus penalties. 
On April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related notices 
affirming  duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals for approximately $386 million. On 
April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the spare parts-related notice affirming duties and penalties 
against HP India and certain of the named individuals for approximately $17 million.
HP India filed appeals of the Commissioner’s orders before the Customs Tribunal. The Customs Department 
filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings 
on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The Customs Tribunal rejected HP India's request to return the 
matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings before the Customs Tribunal were subsequently 
delayed, have been postponed on several occasions since 2014, and have not yet been rescheduled.
ECT Proceedings. In January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos 
(“ECT”), notified a former subsidiary of HP Inc. in Brazil (“HP Brazil”) that it had initiated administrative proceedings 
to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the 
bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies 
allegedly coordinated their bids and fixed results for three ECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT 
notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and 
contract with ECT for five years, based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's 
decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and the administrative proceedings were closed with the 
penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against 
ECT seeking to have ECT’s decision revoked. HP Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of 
the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case, which was denied. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its 
request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a preliminary ruling denying the request 
for injunctive relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from five to two years. HP Brazil appealed that decision 
and, in December 2011, obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of 
the case. HP Brazil expects a resolution of the decision on the merits to take several years.
Forsyth, et al. vs. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. This purported class and collective action was filed 
on August 18, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against HP Inc. and 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging Defendants violated the Federal Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act (“ADEA”), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the 
California Business and Professions Code by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger 
workers. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide collective action under the ADEA comprised of individuals aged 40 
years and older who had their employment terminated by an HP entity pursuant to a work force reduction (“WFR”) 
plan. Plaintiffs also seek to certify a class under California law consisting of all persons 40 years or older employed 
by Defendants in the state of California and terminated pursuant to a WFR plan on or after August 18, 2012. On 
April 14, 2021, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Class Certification was granted. The conditionally certified collective 
action consists of all individuals who had their employment terminated by Defendants pursuant to a WFR Plan on or 
after November 1, 2015, and who were 40 years or older at the time of such termination. The collective action 
excludes all individuals who signed a Waiver and General Release Agreement or an Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. 
The parties have reached an agreement to resolve this matter.  Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Approval of 
the Class Action and Collective Action Settlement on September 21, 2023. On November 3, 2023, the Court issued 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

an order granting preliminary approval to the Class Action and Collective Action Settlement. The Court has 
scheduled a Fairness Hearing to address the parties’ Motion for Final Approval for March 28, 2024.
Oracle America, Inc., et al. v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (Terix copyright matter) . On March 22, 
2016, Oracle filed a complaint against HPE in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 
alleging copyright infringement, interference with contract, intentional interference with prospective economic 
relations, and unfair competition. Oracle’s claims arise out of HPE's prior use of a third-party maintenance provider 
named Terix Computer Company, Inc. (“Terix”). Oracle contends that in connection with HPE's use of Terix as a 
subcontractor for certain customers of HPE's multivendor support business, Oracle’s copyrights were infringed, and 
HPE is liable for vicarious and contributory infringement and related claims. Trial began on May 23, 2022. On June 
15, 2022, the jury returned its verdict, awarding $30 million in compensatory damages to Oracle and rejecting 
Oracle’s request for punitive damages. The parties have since reached an agreement to resolve this dispute. 
Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the case has been dismissed and the matter is closed. 
Q3 Networking Litigation. On September 21 and September 22, 2020, Q3 Networking LLC filed complaints 
against HPE, Aruba Networks, Commscope and Netgear in the United States District Court for the District of 
Delaware and the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”). Both complaints allege infringement of four 
patents, and the ITC complaint defines the “accused products” as “routers, access points, controllers, network 
management servers, other networking products, and hardware and software components thereof.” The ITC action 
was instituted on October 23, 2020. The District of Delaware action has been stayed pending resolution of the ITC 
action. On December 7, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination finding no violation of 
section 337 of the Tariff Act. On May 3, 2022, the ITC issued its Notice of Final Determination, affirming the initial 
determination and terminating the investigation. On June 18, 2022, Q3 Networking filed a petition for review of the 
ITC ruling with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Shared Litigation with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus 
As part of the Separation and Distribution Agreements between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise and DXC, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Seattle SpinCo, the parties to each 
agreement agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' 
businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreements also included provisions that assign to the parties 
responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. (in the 
case of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from HP Inc.) or of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (in the case of 
the separation of DXC from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the separation of Seattle SpinCo from Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise), in each case arising prior to the applicable separation.
Environmental
The Company's operations and products are or may in the future become subject to various federal, state, 
local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of 
pollutants into the air and water; supply chain due diligence, and sustainability, environment, and emissions-related 
reporting; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the clean-up of 
contaminated sites; product compliance and safety; the energy consumption of products, services, and operations; 
and the operational or financial responsibility for recycling, treatment, and disposal of those products. This includes 
legislation that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, subject to certain 
repairability requirements or financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past 
and future covered products (sometimes referred to as “product take-back legislation”). The Company could incur 
substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other 
sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, including those related to addressing 
climate change and other environmental related issues, or if its products become non-compliant with such 
environmental laws. The Company's potential exposure includes impacts on revenue, fines and civil or criminal 
sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of 
costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.
In particular, the Company may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or 
state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
(“CERCLA”), known as “Superfund,” or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations addressing the clean-up 
of contaminated sites, and may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties

for contribution towards clean-up costs. The Company is also contractually obligated to make financial contributions 
to address actions related to certain environmental liabilities, both ongoing and arising in the future, pursuant to its 
Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc.
Note 18: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties
Guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, 
customers and other parties pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the performance obligations of third 
parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the 
Company would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event 
occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material 
guarantee is remote.
The Company has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing 
arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of the Company's non-performance under the contract 
or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, the Company could, under certain circumstances, 
be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. The Company believes the likelihood of having 
to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the 
Company may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the 
services they perform on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the 
particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. The Company 
also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement 
made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of the Company's software products and 
support services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. 
Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.
General Cross-indemnifications 
In connection with the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company entered into a Separation 
and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus respectively, whereby the Company agreed to 
indemnify HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and 
employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the 
liabilities allocated to the Company as part of the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions. Similarly, HP Inc., 
DXC and Micro Focus agreed to indemnify the Company, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective 
directors, officers and employees from and against all claims and liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting 
from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus as part of the Separation, 
Everett and Seattle Transactions. 
Tax Matters Agreement with DXC/Micro Focus and Other Income Tax Matters
In connection with the Everett Transaction and the Seattle Transaction, the Company entered into a Tax 
Matters Agreement with DXC and Micro Focus respectively (the “DXC Tax Matters Agreement” and the “Micro 
Focus Tax Matters Agreement”). The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement 
govern the rights and obligations of the Company and DXC/Micro Focus for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and 
tax receivables. The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement generally provide 
that the Company will be responsible for pre-divestiture tax liabilities and will be entitled to pre-divestiture tax 
receivables that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the Company's and DXC's, or Micro Focus', as 
applicable, U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax returns. In certain jurisdictions, the Company and DXC/Micro Focus have 
joint and several liability for past tax liabilities and accordingly, the Company could be legally liable under applicable 
tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.
In addition, if the distribution of Everett's or Seattle's common shares to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's 
stockholders is determined to be taxable, the Company would generally bear the tax liability, unless the taxability of

the distribution is the direct result of actions taken by DXC/Micro Focus, in which case DXC/Micro Focus would be 
responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.
As of October 31, 2023  and 2022, the Company's receivable and payable balances related to indemnified 
litigation matters and other contingencies, and income tax-related indemnification covered by these agreements 
were as follows:
As of October 31,

(1) The actual amount that the Company may receive or pay could vary depending upon the outcome of certain unresolved tax 
matters, which may not be resolved for several years.

For the fiscal years ended 
October 31,

(1) The Company included the current portion in Other accrued liabilities, and amounts due after one year in Other non-current 
liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note 19: Commitments
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
As of October 31, 2023, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $1.6 billion. 
These unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable 
and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to 
be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction, as well as 
settlements that the Company has reached with third parties, requiring it to pay determined amounts over a 
specified period of time. These unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, 
software maintenance and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude 
agreements that are cancellable without penalty. The Company expects the commitments to total $580 million, 
$293 million, $317 million, $310 million, $46 million, and $5 million for fiscal years 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 
and thereafter, respectively.

Note 20: Equity Method Investments
The Company includes investments which are accounted for using the equity method, under Investments in 
equity interests on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's 
Investments in equity interests was  $2.2 billion and primarily related to a 49% equity interest in H3C Technologies 
Co., Limited (“H3C”).
Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, Unisplendour 
International Technology Limited (“UNIS”), and H3C dated as of May 1, 2016, as amended from time to time, and 
most recently on October 28, 2022, the Company delivered a notice to UNIS on December 30, 2022, to exercise its 
right to put to UNIS, for cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by the Company, which represent 49% of the 
total issued share capital of H3C. On May 26, 2023, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries entered into a Put Share 
Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby UNIS has agreed to purchase all of the H3C shares held by the 
Company, through its subsidiaries, for total pre-tax cash consideration of $3.5 billion. The disposition remains 
subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and completion of certain conditions necessary for closing.
For the periods presented, the Company recorded its interest in the net earnings of H3C, prepared in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP on a one-month lag, along with an adjustment to eliminate unrealized profits on intra-
entity sales, and the amortization of basis difference, within Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings.
The difference between the sale date carrying value of the Company's investment in H3C and its proportionate 
share of the net assets fair value of H3C, created a basis difference of $2.5 billion, which was allocated as follows:
In millions
Equity method goodwill $ 1,674 
Intangible assets  749 
In-process research and development  188 
Deferred tax liabilities  (152) 
Other  75 
Basis difference $ 2,534 
The Company amortizes the basis difference over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to this 
difference. The weighted-average life of the H3C intangible assets is five years and is being amortized using the 
straight-line method. As of October 31, 2023, the difference between the cost of the investment and the underlying 
equity in the net assets of the investment is $1,677 million. As of October 31, 2023  and 2022, the Company 
determined that no impairment of its equity method investments existed. 
Earnings from equity interests
The Company recorded earnings from equity interests of $245 million, $215 million and $180 million in fiscal 
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the components of which are as 
follows:
For the fiscal years ended October 31,
2023 2022 2021
In millions
Earnings from equity interests, net of taxes(1) $ 242 $ 270 $ 292 
Basis difference amortization  (9)  (45)  (109) 
Adjustment of profit on intra-entity sales  12  (10)  (3) 
Earnings from equity interests $ 245 $ 215 $ 180 
(1)  For fiscal 2023, earnings (loss) from equity interests, net of taxes include $244 million, which reflected the Company’s 
portion of intangible asset impairment charges of $(8) million, from H3C and $(2) million  from other venture investments. 
For fiscal 2022, and 2021 earnings (loss) from equity interests, net of taxes included $275 million and $260 million from H3C 
and $(5) million and $32 million from other venture investments, respectively.

For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company received a cash dividend of $200 million and $197 million, 
respectively, from H3C. This amount was accounted for as a return on investment and reflected as a reduction in 
the carrying balance of the Company's Investments in equity interests in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company also has commercial arrangements with H3C to buy and sell HPE branded servers, storage 
and networking products and services. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, HPE recorded approximately $383 million, 
$848 million and $794 million of sales to H3C and $125 million, $148 million and $150 million of purchases from 
H3C, respectively. Payables due to H3C as of October 31, 2023  and 2022 were approximately $10 million and 
$22 million , respectively. Receivables due from H3C as of October 31, 2023  and 2022 were approximately 
$12 million and $18 million, respectively.
A summary of H3C’s statements of operations for the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2023, 2022 
and 2021 and balance sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer

disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the

officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective such that the information relating to the Company, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to 
be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, 
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions 
regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer 
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes in our internal control over financial 
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during 
our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal 
financial officer concluded that there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during 
that quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial 
reporting. 
ITEM 9B. Other Information.

Regulation S-K, Item 408.
Exchange Act Section 13(r) Disclosure
On March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Russian Federal Security Service (“FSB”) as a 
party subject to the provisions of U.S. Executive Order No. 13382 issued in 2005 (“Executive Order 13382”). On the 
same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) updated General 
License 1B (“General License 1B”) which generally authorizes U.S. companies to engage in certain licensing, 
permitting, certification, notification, and related transactions with the FSB as may be required for the importation, 
distribution, or use of information technology products in the Russian Federation. Our local Russian subsidiary 
(“HPE Russia”) may be required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and to file documents. There are 
no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by HPE with the FSB and all such 
dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B. We plan to continue these activities as required to support 
our orderly and managed wind down of our Russia operations.
On April 15, 2021, the U.S. Government issued an executive order on Blocking Property with Respect to 
Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation (“Executive Order 14024”), 
implementing additional U.S. sanctions against the Russian government and against Russian actors that threaten 
U.S. interests, including certain technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Service. The U.S. 
Secretary of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (“Positive Technologies”) under Executive Order 
14024 and Executive Order 13382. HPE Russia had dealings with Positive Technologies prior to its designation. 
Following the sanctions designation, HPE Russia immediately initiated procedures to terminate its relationship with 
140


Page 143:
Positive Technologies. HPE does not plan to engage in any further transactions with this entity, except wind down 
activities that are authorized by OFAC going forward. HPE Russia continues to have blocked property associated 
with Positive Technologies. No action will be taken unless and until a license is received from OFAC authorizing 
collection of the property. There are no identifiable gross revenues or net profits associated with HPE’s activities 
related to Positive Technologies for this reporting period.
