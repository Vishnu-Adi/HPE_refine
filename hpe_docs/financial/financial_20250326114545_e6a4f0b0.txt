PART I
ITEM 1. Business
We are a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, 
analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. We enable customers to accelerate business outcomes 
by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational 
efficiency today and into the future. Our customers range from small-and-medium-sized businesses to large global 
enterprises and governmental entities. Our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. 
Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to 
providing innovative technological solutions to our customers.
We use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise Company.
Our Strategy  
Over the last several years, new megatrends around edge, cloud, data, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) have 
emerged to shape customer expectations for enterprise technology. First, data at the edge is increasing 
exponentially, driven by the proliferation of devices that require secure connectivity to enable reliable digital 
experiences. Second, enterprises need a cloud experience everywhere to manage data and workloads wherever 
they live across a distributed enterprise. Third, data growth is creating countless new opportunities to generate 
meaningful business insights. Finally, HPE is seeing a significant technology shift as customers realize the 
fundamental potential of AI technology to deliver business transformation.  
In concert with these trends, enterprises are consuming their technology differently. Increasingly, customers 
want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the 
information technology (“IT”) they use. 
The megatrends are ushering in long-lasting changes to IT, including accelerating hybrid multi-cloud adoption. 
Customers across industry verticals are interested in unifying all the applications and data with a consistent cloud 
experience.
Customers also want to better extract value from their growing stores of rapidly evolving data, knowing that 
actionable insights from data are critical to deliver business transformations. Data is becoming more unstructured, 
more time-sensitive, and more distributed. Frequently, data is siloed and spread across different multi-generational 
IT systems, often trapped in critical legacy architecture. Many organizations cannot adequately gain insights from 
their data at the edge or face cloud migration challenges because of their legacy applications. Customers need a 
data-first modernization approach across edge to data center to cloud.
HPE has deployed an edge-to-cloud strategy that capitalizes on emergent megatrends and delivers a data-
first modernization approach for customers. Our vision to be the edge-to-cloud company has led us to innovate our 
solutions across networking connectivity, cloud, and data, delivered as-a-service (“aaS”) through the HPE 
GreenLake cloud. We have shifted our mix of products and services, and how we deliver that mix to customers. 
HPE has evolved to a platform-based model, fueled by a portfolio richer in software and services. In hybrid cloud, 
we have redefined the cloud space by delivering an experience that is hybrid by design with our HPE GreenLake 
cloud as the centerpiece of our strategy; it accelerates multi-generation IT transformation through a unified cloud-
native and AI-driven experience that empowers customers to access, analyze, and extract value from their data 
across public clouds, data centers, colocation facilities, and at the edge. The AI market requires a modern and high-
performing networking fabric as a core foundation to deliver a more efficient data-center cloud, which we offer 
through our AI-driven portfolio of networking solutions. Our server business supports both traditional servers and 
those meant to enable AI workloads with decades of large-scale infrastructure expertise, including technologies like 
direct liquid cooling that are powering some of our largest AI systems. Our Financial Services (“FS”) business 
complements our solution offerings by helping customers unlock financial capacity.
We recognize the AI market will be driven by computational capability, data-intensive workloads, and the need 
for specialized architecture; thus, we have been targeting, and continue to target three areas: supercomputing, AI 
infrastructure, and AI platform software. We seek to seize this AI market opportunity by innovating in networking, 
hybrid cloud and AI – which are all essential building blocks to deliver a unified technology experience. We believe 
that we are differentiated from our competition by our unique and compelling value proposition, which positions us 
to capture significant value from the growing AI market through our intellectual property portfolio, trusted expertise, 
and long-term sustained market leadership in supercomputing.

The pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, Inc. ("Juniper Networks") further supports the aforementioned 
strategies and enables us to execute on them. We believe this acquisition will accelerate our edge-to-cloud vision 
with a full networking IP stack: from silicon, to infrastructure, to the operating system, to security, to software and 
services, in a cloud-native and AI-driven approach. Furthermore, through this strategic acquisition, we seek to 
deliver secure, AI-driven networking solutions, which will be foundational to delivering fully integrated hybrid cloud 
and AI solutions.
Our Business Segments, Products and Services 
Our operations are organized into five reportable business segments: Server, Hybrid Cloud, Intelligent Edge, 
Financial Services, and Corporate Investments and Other. The class of similar product categories within each 
segment which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue in each of the past three years was 
as follows:
• Fiscal 2024 - Server products, Server services, Intelligent Edge products, Hybrid Cloud products
• Fiscal 2023 - Server products, Intelligent Edge products, Server services, Hybrid Cloud products
• Fiscal 2022 - Server products, Server services, Hybrid Cloud products, Intelligent Edge products
The Company had two distributors which represented approximately 14% and 11% of the Company's total net 
revenue in fiscal 2024, primarily within the Intelligent Edge and Server segments. 
A summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments can be found in Note 2, 
“Segment Information,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. A discussion of certain factors 
potentially affecting our operations is set forth in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”
Server
Our Server segment offerings consist of general-purpose servers for multi-workload computing and workload-
optimized servers to deliver the high performance and value for demanding applications, and integrated systems 
comprised of software and hardware designed to address high-performance computing and supercomputing 
(including exascale applications), artificial intelligence, data analytics, and transaction processing workloads for 
government and commercial customers globally. This portfolio of products includes our secure and versatile HPE 
ProLiant Rack and Tower servers; HPE Synergy, a composable infrastructure for traditional and cloud-native 
applications; HPE Scale Up Servers product lines for critical applications, including large enterprise software 
applications and data analytics platforms; HPE Edgeline servers; HPE Cray EX; HPE Cray XD (formerly known as

and as standalone services. 
Hybrid Cloud 
The Hybrid Cloud segment offers a wide variety of cloud-native and hybrid solutions across storage, private 
cloud and the infrastructure software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) space. Storage includes data storage and data 
management offerings with the HPE Alletra Storage portfolio; unstructured data solutions and analytics for AI; data 
protection and archiving; and storage networking. It also includes AIOps-driven intelligence with HPE InfoSight and 
HPE CloudPhysics. In private cloud, our Private Cloud Enterprise offerings include new cloud-native offerings and 
capabilities for virtual machines, containers, and bare metal; a full suite of private cloud offerings that enable 
customers to self-manage or choose a fully managed experience. In fiscal 2024, we launched a new offering, 
Private Cloud AI, that captures the emerging enterprise model fine-tuning, retrieval augmented generation and 
inference markets for AI solutions. Private Cloud AI is fully integrated, standardized offer that has been co-
developed with AI market leader Nvidia, with the goal to provide an out of the box solution for enterprise AI. This 
segment also provides self-service private cloud on-demand with HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business 
Edition. Infrastructure software includes monitoring and observability for day two operations and beyond through our 
acquisition of OpsRamp and unified data access through our HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric and analytics suite, which 
helps move and transform data for use in AI and other applications. Hybrid Cloud segment also includes data 
lifecycle management and protection through our suite of offerings, including Zerto Disaster Recovery. 
Intelligent Edge
The Intelligent Edge segment offers wired and wireless local area networks, campus, branch, and data center 
switching, software-defined wide-area-networks, private and public cellular network software, network security, and 
associated services that enable secure connectivity for businesses of any size. The HPE Aruba Networking product 
portfolio includes hardware products such as Wi-Fi access points, switches, and gateways. The HPE Aruba

Networking software and services portfolio includes cloud-based management, network management, network 
access control, software-defined wide-area networking, network security, analytics and assurance, location services 
software, private and public cellular core software, and professional and support services, as well as aaS and 
consumption models through the HPE GreenLake cloud for the Intelligent Edge portfolio of products. Intelligent 
Edge offerings are consolidated in the edge service platform, which takes a cloud-native approach that provides 
customers with a unified framework to meet their connectivity, security, and financial needs across campus, branch, 
data center, and remote worker environments. Upon closing of the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, we 
expect to offer an even more comprehensive portfolio of networking solutions.
 Financial Services
Financial Services (“FS”) provides flexible investment solutions, such as leasing, financing, IT consumption, 
utility programs, and asset management services for customers that facilitate unique technology deployment models 
and the acquisition of complete IT solutions, including hardware, software, and services from Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise and others. FS also supports financial solutions for on-premise flexible consumption models, such as the 
HPE GreenLake cloud. 
Corporate Investments and Other 
Corporate Investments and Other includes the Advisory and Professional Services business, which primarily 
offers consultative-led services, HPE and partner technology expertise and advice, implementation services as well 
as complex solution engagement capabilities; the Communications and Media Solutions business, which primarily 
offers software and related services to the telecommunications industry; and Hewlett Packard Labs, which is 
responsible for research and development.
Our Strengths 
We believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, 
including:
• Edge-to-cloud strategy and solutions uniquely solve customer challenges. As data grows and evolves, 
enterprises become increasingly distributed, and customers realize the potential in AI technology, HPE’s 
edge-to-cloud strategy is uniquely designed to enable customers to securely access, control, and maximize 
the value of all their workloads and data assets to accelerate business outcomes. The HPE GreenLake 
cloud is an open, secure, fully integrated platform that brings a unified experience across the edge, data 
center, colocation, and cloud. It is automated and easy to consume with capacity available to scale up and 
down on demand. It offers true pay per use consumption so customers only pay for what they use, and they 
can have the entire hybrid cloud experience managed for them through our HPE Managed Services 
offerings.
• Comprehensive portfolio. We have a distinctive and industry leading portfolio of edge-to-cloud solutions and 
capabilities to help accelerate our customers' digital transformations and help them capture the opportunity 
that AI presents for their businesses. We combine our software-defined infrastructure and services 
capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise solutions in the IT industry. 
Our ability to deliver a comprehensive IT strategy and connect our customers' data from edge to cloud, 
through our high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services in a single package, is 
one of our principal differentiators.
• Differentiated consumption-based IT solutions for a growing opportunity. Enterprises of all sizes are looking 
to digitally transform in order to develop next-generation cloud-native applications, create actionable 
insights from their data, and drive business growth, but they face many challenges including lack of in-
house IT skills, limited budgets and options for financing, and lack of flexibility to choose the technology 
foundation that best meets their needs. Consumption-based IT offers solutions to these challenges by 
providing greater agility, which empowers people to shift from managing infrastructure to driving innovation 
by leveraging insights from their data, while also eliminating capital and operating expenses tied to 
infrastructure over-provisioning. HPE is distinctly differentiated in delivering a true consumption-based IT 
experience. 
• Open platforms. The world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a 
future of centers of data everywhere, which are highly decentralized and distributed. This shift demands a 
unified cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to customers’ data sources to create 
real-time insights everywhere. We believe the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all 
our customers' clouds, rather than requiring customers to be locked into a cloud stack. 
5


Page 8:
• Multi-year innovation roadmap and strong balance sheet. We have been in the technology and innovation 
business for over 80 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development 
capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the 
expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments such as cloud, 
artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and cybersecurity to drive business transformations now and in the 
future. We also have a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile that provide the financial flexibility and 
speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.
• Global distribution and partner ecosystem. We are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions to 
our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor, and/or multi-language environments. We have 
expansive go-to-market capabilities, including a large ecosystem of channel partners, which enables us to 
market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world. Our HPE 
GreenLake cloud provides open cloud application programming interfaces to our partners, enabling them to 
better offer their unique solutions to customers. 
• Custom financial solutions. Through our FS segment, we help customers create investment capacity to 
accelerate their transformations by helping them free up capital, capture value from older assets, achieve 
sustainability goals, invest in new technologies aaS, and weather financial volatility. FS is also an enabler of 
our consumption-based IT models by helping spread our upfront solution costs over the duration of the 
customer contract. Through FS’ Technology Renewal Centers, we are helping customers achieve their own 
sustainability goals by refurbishing technology assets for reuse. 
• Experienced leadership team. Our management team has an extensive track record of performance and 
execution. We are led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Antonio Neri, who has proven 
experience in developing transformative business models, building global brands, and driving sustained 
growth and expansion in the technology industry. Mr. Neri's experience includes more than 25 years 
combined at HPE and Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP Co.”) in various leadership positions. Our senior 
management team has many years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of 
and experience in the enterprise IT business and the markets in which we compete. 
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 
We manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our 
customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector 
enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly 
through a variety of partners, including:
• resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to 
targeted customer groups;
• distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;
• original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that integrate our products and services with their own products 
and services, and sell the integrated solution;
• independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist 
us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products;
• systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often 
partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and
• advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems 
integration work, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and 
services.
The mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We 
believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales, 
marketing, and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in 
addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. This has 
resulted in a combined go-to-market model, in which we have a direct sales presence in a number of countries, 
while we sell and deliver our products, solutions, and services through a channel-only model in the remaining 
countries. In those countries where we have a direct sales presence, we follow a bifurcated sales operational model 
with separate go-to-market routes for high-velocity, transactional hardware sales, on the one hand and for services 
and solutions, on the other hand. Also, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our 
business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts. The account manager is 
6


Page 9:
supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers, our businesses 
collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts, both in the commercial 
and public sector space.
Manufacturing and Materials  
We utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture 
products that we design. The use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies 
and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and 
processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our 
brand. In addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number 
of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. 
Historically, we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order 
and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies 
by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units 
to match a customer's particular hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management 
and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize 
inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution 
of products to our customers.
We purchase materials, supplies, and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most 
of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily 
available. However, we do rely on single-source suppliers for certain customized parts (although some of these 
sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption) and a disruption or loss of a single-source 
supplier could delay production of some products. In some instances, our single-source suppliers (e.g., Intel and 
AMD as suppliers of certain x86 processors) are also the single-source suppliers for the entire market; disruptions 
with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately 
disadvantage us relative to our competitors.
Like other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a 
combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 
90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain 
components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are 
geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher 
prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin, but does not generally disrupt 
production. We also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints, or enter into longer-term 
pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. See “Risk Factors” in Item 
1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “We depend on third-party suppliers, and our 
financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly.”
We rely on proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position ourselves well for availability of those 
components. We intend to take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment to the market demand, and 
plan to continue leveraging strong partnerships and long-term agreements with our suppliers.

Backlog represents the price of orders related to current or prior periods for which work has not been 
performed or goods have not been delivered as of the reporting period. Orders reflected in backlog are subject to 
adjustment, including as a result of re-bookings, cancellations and fulfillment issues, which may impact backlog. 
The adverse impact of the global pandemic on the supply chain has moderated, resulting in a more balanced 
supply-and-demand environment and improved component availability. Challenges in global logistics have mostly 
normalized despite some uncertainty related to regional conflicts and port labor disputes. Our overall demand 
pipeline has improved since the beginning of fiscal 2024 as customers have been digesting through their inventory. 
Even though demand across our AI product portfolio, including for high performance graphics and accelerated 
processing units, continues to be somewhat uneven, due to the lumpiness of deals that can cause fluctuations 
quarter-to-quarter, AI systems demand in the midst of persisting data center space availability constraints continued 
to drive significant AI backlog. The supply and demand environment for GPUs continues to remain uneven as the 
market navigates transition to next generation GPUs. These dynamics have resulted in our inventory levels being 
elevated as compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, and we are closely monitoring inventory levels as 
the market navigates a transition to next-generation GPUs.

International 
Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe geographic diversity allows us to meet 
demand on a worldwide basis for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide 
workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic 
trends, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. 
A summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to our 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. Approximately 64% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2024 
came from sales outside the United States.
For a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part 
I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings “Due to the international nature of our business, political or 
economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could 
harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition,” and “We are exposed to fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” in Item 7A of Part II, 
and Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
Research and Development 
Innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development efforts 
(“R&D”) are focused on designing and developing products, services, and solutions that anticipate customers' 
changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the 
areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology 
companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences. 
Expenditures for R&D were $2.2 billion in fiscal 2024, $2.3 billion fiscal 2023, and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022. 
We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in the future to support the design and 
development of innovative, high-quality products, services, and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive 
position.
Included in the R&D work currently taking place at the Company are the following initiatives:
In Server, we are developing high-quality next-generation compute solutions that encompass servers, server-
attached options, and software, integrating the latest industry technology and aligning with our customers' evolving 
needs. Furthermore, we are advancing our SaaS capabilities by creating cloud-native, cloud-based server 
management solutions to enhance our existing portfolio. In the high performance computing and AI sector, our 
investments are focused on pioneering leadership computing solutions that deliver superior performance and 
efficiency. These solutions feature leading edge silicon architectures, high-speed interconnects, advanced storage 
and innovative direct liquid cooling. Our R&D efforts in the realm of AI are particularly robust, with new server 
solutions designed for AI inference engines and integrated into larger HPE Private Cloud AI for inferencing, retrieval 
augmented generation, and model fine-tuning. Large-scale model training and tuning, including natural language 
processing, large language models, and multi-modal training for models with trillions of parameters are supported 
by our leading AI solutions. These efforts are bolstered by the development of high-performance computing tools, 
cloud-native and scalable cluster management software, and transaction processing software, which have been 
instrumental in achieving our milestone of delivering the world's first exascale supercomputer.
In Hybrid Cloud, we are investing in a comprehensive portfolio of storage and private cloud technologies and 
capabilities that are focused on enabling customers to transform through the power of data and AI, modernize their 
IT infrastructure and simplify hybrid operations, delivering a cloud operational experience via the HPE GreenLake 
cloud. We continue to invest in the storage portfolio aligned with the customers evolving data and AI needs. We 
have extended the deployment model from on-premise and cloud-adjacent to include software-defined cloud native 
deployments in Amazon Web Services. In private cloud, we are developing fully integrated hardware-software offers 
that simplify day-to-day management, operations and data protection, enables an on-premise public-cloud like 
experience while addressing security, privacy, governance, and regulatory compliance needs. The investment 
includes airgapped/disconnected offers and offers for heavy data traffic and latency requirements at the edge. In the 
AI space, we have invested in building turn-key integrated systems co-engineered with Nvidia that integrate HPE AI 
hardware and software technologies with Nvidia technologies to radically increase time to value of GenAI 
capabilities optimized for inferencing, retrieval augmented generation, and model fine-tuning. We have expanded 
our cloud observability and orchestration capabilities and virtualization options through the acquisitions of OpsRamp 
(observability) and Morpheus (orchestration), extending our ability to simplify IT complexity in multi-cloud and multi-
vendor environments. Finally, we have been rapidly developing an enterprise-grade hypervisor for virtual machines,

along with the ability to manage cloud-native applications using containerization, or specialized workload needs with 
bare metal as a service.
In Intelligent Edge, we are investing in a broad portfolio of networking and security capabilities, addressing 
remote, branch, campus, data center, and cloud use cases. We are expanding our wireless access portfolio to 
include new Wi-Fi (e.g., Wi-Fi 7) and private cellular (4G, LTE, and 5G) products to complement our existing 
portfolio. We have expanded our security capabilities with last year’s acquisition of Secure Service Edge (“SSE”) 
provider Axis Security and delivering stand-alone SSE, and integrating security with our software-defined wide area 
network (“SD-WAN”) capabilities to deliver a single-vendor Secure Access Services Edge solution. In our Ethernet 
Switch portfolio, we are investing in new Data Center Networking platforms and features to expand our total 
addressable market to complement the campus and branch segment. We leverage the HPE GreenLake cloud to 
provide consistent access to our aaS capabilities and enable new business models, including network-as-a-service. 
We also are investing in automation, machine learning, and AI-based network operations to optimize user 
experience and improve operator efficiency, as exemplified by our cloud-native Aruba Central cloud service, which is 
expected to provide manageability across our entire portfolio, including Wireless LAN, Ethernet switching, SD-WAN, 
and security. 
In Hewlett Packard Labs, we are focused on disruptive innovation and applied research in collaboration with 
other HPE business groups to deliver differentiated intellectual property. Our innovation agenda is focused on 
developing technologies in the areas of system architecture, networking, AI, sustainability, edge-to-cloud, quantum 
computing, and sustainability. We also continue to invest in our silicon design capability to accelerate the 
development and delivery of our technology.
For a discussion of risks attendant to our R&D activities, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K under the heading “If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, including 
offering our entire portfolio aaS, our business, operating results, and financial performance may suffer.”
Patents 
Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products 
and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. As of October 31, 
2024, our worldwide patent portfolio included approximately 13,000 issued and pending patents.
Patents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been 
built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our 
patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and 
services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to 
participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself 
essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments.
In addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem 
appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when 
we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-
licenses with third parties.
For a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see “Risk factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings “Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to 
develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” and “Our products and 
services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.” 
Seasonality
From time to time, the markets in which we sell our products, services, and solutions experience weak 
economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our 
products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months. See “Risk factors” in 
Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain 
disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.”
Competition
We have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products, solutions, and services which 
includes our aaS offerings. We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We compete primarily on 
the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of 
9


Page 12:
products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, 
security, and the availability of our IT infrastructure offerings.
The markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with 
long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are 
relatively short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, continuously enhance our 
existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among others. In 
addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture, 
and market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner 
relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices 
on many of our products and services to stay competitive.
The competitive environments in which our segments operate are described below:

For a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see “Risk factors” in Item 1A of 
Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and 
competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.”
Human Capital Resources
At HPE we are united by our purpose, which is to advance the way people live and work. We believe 
technology’s greatest promise lies in its potential for positive change. This is the guidepost for each decision we 
make at HPE. We believe it not only helps guide our contribution to society, but also makes good business sense. 
Our company strives to be an engine of innovation, and our approximately 61,000 employees as of October 31, 
2024, are proud of the ways our technology enables our customers to achieve meaningful outcomes like curing 
disease, modernizing farming, addressing world-hunger, and democratizing transportation through autonomous 
vehicles. 
Our Culture - We recognize the importance of talent and culture to the success of HPE and our ability to fulfill 
our purpose. We have identified four key cultural beliefs that guide how we lead on a daily basis: accelerating what’s 
next, bold moves, the “power of yes we can,” and being a force for good. We embed these beliefs in a deep-rooted 
DNA that puts customers first, enabling us to partner, innovate, and act with integrity. HPE has remained committed 
to its focus on internalizing these values into a vibrant culture that creates a superior team member experience and 
a highly engaged workforce, driving improvements across our communications, our reward programs, our talent/
performance programs, and our work environment. Through such efforts, we aim to foster a collaborative, inclusive, 
and inspiring experience for all our team members and to make HPE a destination for talent while driving high-
performance and growth opportunities for our team members, and innovation and excellence for our customers. In 
the midst of the above, we continually seek feedback from our team members to better understand and improve 
their experiences and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - At HPE, we are committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace. 
By fostering a culture where our people can freely contribute their perspectives, ideas, and experiences, we can fuel 
innovation, drive transformational changes, and be a force for good by harnessing the potential of our technologies 
and our team members. In 2024, we continued to advance our global approach of enhancing the composition of our 
workforce, by selecting regional leaders responsible for engaging team members, core human resources 
professionals, business stakeholders, and external partners to identify areas of focus to advance unconditional 
inclusion. We also expanded our voluntary, and confidential self-identification program, “Count me in. I belong!” from 
the US, Puerto Rico and the U.K, to include Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia and India for the first time. We 
continue to develop new and inclusive pipelines of talent in science, technology, engineering, and math (“STEM”) 
professions through our dedicated HPE STEM Discovery Program. This program equips and enables HPE team 
members to serve as STEM education and digital inclusion volunteers in their local communities, exposing learners 
to cutting-edge technology and raising awareness about careers in technology. The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Voice of the Workforce index within our annual global engagement survey continued to reveal strong engagement 
scores across our ethnically diverse and female team members. Our Board, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and 
Executive Committee model high standards for our efforts to drive an unconditionally inclusive environment and 
oversee efforts throughout the Company leadership to continuously develop their inclusive leadership acumen.
Talent - We are dedicated to attracting, developing, and retaining top talent through substantial investment. 
Our commitment extends to all career stages. We establish transparent goals, promote accountability, and 
continuously evaluate and nurture talent. About 95% of employees engaged in HPE’s “My Success Plan” program, 
which entails quarterly 1:1 conversations with leaders, centered on performance, progress, and career aspirations. 
The dynamic nature of our industry allows team members to thrive in their current roles while acquiring new skills. 
Over the past year, our approximately 61,000 team members completed over 821,000 online and instructor-led 
courses across various categories, including leadership, inclusion and diversity, professional skills, technical 
training, and compliance. We are particularly focused on identifying and cultivating the next generation of 
exceptional leaders, emphasizing technical expertise. Our annual talent and succession review, conducted with our 
CEO and Executive Committee, aims to accelerate talent development, enhance succession pipelines, and improve 
diversity in our key positions. 
Pay Equity - We believe people should be paid equitably for what they do and how they do it, regardless of 
their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We maintain policies to promote equal pay, and we regularly 
review our global pay practices with an aim to pay team members in similar roles and locations commensurately 
with their experience and responsibilities. We partner with independent third-party experts to conduct annual pay 
assessments and identify unexplained gaps between our present state and our goal of equitable pay treatment for 
all team members. Where these reviews identify such gaps at a country-wide level, we adjust compensation to 
11


Page 14:
eliminate the gap. As a result of our efforts, our most recent pay equity review demonstrated that we have achieved 
pay parity for base compensation and bonus targets between male and female team members in the U.S. (including 
among underrepresented ethnicities), and a dozen additional countries throughout the world, when accounting for 
job title, time-in-role, experience, and location. We conduct a number of compensation analyses in other countries 
to provide competitive and equitable pay. 
Work That Fits Your Life - This global initiative, which was launched in 2019, is an important example of how 
HPE is investing in our culture and creating a team member experience that aims to make HPE a destination of 
choice for the best talent in the industry. It includes an industry-leading paid parental leave program (minimum 6 
months), part-time work opportunities for new parents or team members transitioning to retirement, and “Wellness 
Fridays” that allows team members a full Friday off four times per year to focus on their well-being. The HPE Global 
Wellness Program is a comprehensive program that promotes overall health and well-being by providing team 
members with programs and resources that offer flexibility built around team member needs while continuing to 
deliver on critical business results. The program consists of four pillars: physical health, financial well-being, mental 
and emotional health, and community well-being. Additionally, we offer a hybrid work environment for the majority of 
our team members, encouraging two days in the office per week for collaboration.
Total Rewards - HPE requires a uniquely talented workforce and is committed to providing total rewards that 
are market-competitive and performance based, designed to drive innovation and operational excellence. Our 
compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance 
that aligns with, and drives stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive 
range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and 
retain key talent.
Board Oversight - Our Board of Directors oversees our human capital management strategy and programs. 
Our HR and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our human resources and workforce management 
programs, including but not limited to those related to corporate culture; compensation plans and policies; diversity 
and inclusion; and talent acquisition, development, and retention.
HPE’s strong and healthy culture is critical to accelerating what’s next for our customers and partners – and 
the success of our company. We believe that a workforce that is energized and more engaged will fuel our ability to 
pivot and grow, which will, in turn, power the next chapter at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
Environmental Sustainability 
Living Progress is our business strategy for creating sustainable and responsible IT solutions that meet the 
technology demands of the future, while advancing the way people live and work. Anchored to our edge-to-cloud 
offerings and bolstered by our sustainability credentials, our Living Progress strategy provides us with a competitive 
advantage in the market as we help our customers achieve not only their business objectives, but also their IT 
sustainability goals. A legacy of sustainability leadership supports talent acquisition and retention and enables 
ongoing access to global markets. The HPE Board of Directors, including through its committees, provides oversight 
of our Living Progress strategy, risks, practices, policies, and disclosures, to support integration with our core 
business strategy. 
Sustainability performance is a core business discipline within HPE. HPE aims to become a net-zero 
enterprise by 2040, with interim targets set across our value chain for 2030. These climate targets are approved by 
the Science Based Target initiative and align with the latest climate science. Our commitment is supported by our 
Net-Zero Roadmap, which defines the levers we plan to prioritize to enable us to deliver on our near- and long-term 
carbon emissions reduction targets and outlines key assumptions with respect to our reduction targets.
In 2024, the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions resulted from our customers' use of our products and 
solutions. We recognize the opportunity to innovate technologies for a carbon-constrained world and are committed 
to delivering products and solutions that empower our customers to reduce the carbon footprints of their IT estates 
while also gaining maximum productivity from their IT investments and reducing costs. For instance, the latest 
generation of HPE ProLiant Gen 11 Servers enables customers to consolidate and grow compute capabilities while 
lowering the cost of power, cooling, floor space, and licensing. 
To enable market access across the globe and aid customers in selecting more sustainable IT solutions, many 
of our products are certified by eco-labels such as Electronic Product Environment Assessment Tool, Energy STAR, 
China SEPA and the China Energy Conservation Program.

Supply Chain Responsibility and Human Rights 
We manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social 
goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for our customers, partners, and suppliers. We are 
conscious of the importance of the responsible use of our products. In an effort to prevent intended and unintended 
harm, we continue to consider who purchases our offerings and how they are used by, among other things, limiting 
features, including responsible use clauses, monitoring for risk of alternate end uses, and promoting deployment of 
AI with safeguards, such as user training and ongoing checks and refinement to mitigate bias and improve 
accuracy.
Human rights principles are embedded in how we do business, and we are committed to holding our entire 
value chain to high ethical standards that respect such principles. We have processes in place to enable the early 
detection of forced labor and have implemented due diligence procedures to monitor and help prevent human rights 
violations or abuses at our suppliers and in our operations. Additionally, through our Responsible Minerals Program, 
we work to advance the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products and within our supply chain.
Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion extends beyond our workforce and to our suppliers, as well. 
We believe a diverse supply chain and equity in sourcing not only creates opportunities for underrepresented and 
underserved communities, but also contributes to the resiliency of our supply chain and of our communities.
We are also committed to the responsible and ethical development and deployment of new technologies to 
advance how we live and work, and we continue to build on our existing responsible development work, particularly 
in relation to AI. We have an executive level AI Ethics Responsibility Committee and an operational AI Ethics 
Working Group, through which we aim to align the development, deployment, and use of AI with HPE's AI Ethical 
Principles, promoting privacy-enabled and secure, human focused, inclusive, robust, and responsible use of AI. In 
2022, we refined our approach to assessing ethical AI and rolled out AI Ethical Principles training. In 2023, we 
further advanced this initiative by launching three new sub-committees to help us operationalize our principles for: 
Products (AI we develop), Processes (AI we source to use), and Partnerships (AI we source to incorporate into our 
solutions). In 2024, we rolled out a broader AI Governance model and developed tools to drive efficiency in the AI 
ethics assessment process.
While the HPE Board of Directors and all of its committees take an integrated, rather than siloed, approach to 
providing oversight of Living Progress matters, including environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, 
and human rights, our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee is primarily responsible for 
oversight of our broader Living Progress strategy, initiatives, risks, and policies.
Material Government Regulations 
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products and 
services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these 
governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and 
competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our 
operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of 
operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government 
regulations. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that global trade and certain environmental regulations 
could potentially materially impact our business.
Environment 
Our products and operations are, or may in the future be, subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign 
laws and regulations concerning the environment, including, among others, laws addressing the discharge of 
pollutants into the air and water; supply chain due diligence, and sustainability, environment and emissions-related 
reporting; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of 
contaminated sites; product compliance and safety, such as repairability, chemical composition, packaging and 
labeling; energy consumption of our products and services; and the manufacture and distribution of chemical 
substances. We proactively evaluate, and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into 
account, among other things, published lists of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, 
customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment. 
We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, 
including servers and networking equipment, subject to certain repairability requirements or financially responsible 
for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred 
to as “product take-back legislation”). We are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to 
13


Page 16:
sustainability issues such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, reusing or recycling. Finally, as climate 
change and other environmental-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are adopted 
and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or 
other sanctions, including fines. In the event our products are impacted by these laws or standards, our products 
could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private 
companies, and we could face other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be 
fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are 
collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be 
used to address climate change and other environmental-related issues, and to facilitate compliance with related 
laws, regulations and treaties. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental and 
environmental-related laws applicable to our operations, products and services, and to reducing our environmental 
impact across all aspects of our business. We support this commitment with a range of comprehensive policies, 
including relating to environmental, health and safety, climate, water, and electronic waste; a strict environmental 
management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services; an extensive supply chain 
responsibility program; and an approach to ethical standards and strong governance that are the foundations of our 
business.
Global Trade 
As a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations 
including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules 
around the world. Such laws, rules, and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact 
our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and 
individuals, or the need to comply with domestic preference programs, laws concerning transfer and disclosure of 
sensitive or controlled technology or source code, unique technical standards, localization mandates, and 
duplicative in-country testing and inspection requirements. The consequences of any failure to comply with 
domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally. We continue to support 
open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated cross-border supply chains that will continue to 
contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to 
ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements. 
For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact us, see 
“Regulatory and Government Risks” within “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. 
You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or 
financial condition. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” and the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Risk Factors Summary
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations, and 
financial results. 
Business and Operational Risks 
• If we cannot successfully ex ecute our go-to-market strategy, including offering our entire portfolio as-a-
Service, our business, operating results, and financial performance may suffer. 
• We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier 
relationships properly.
• System security risks, data protection incidents, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt 
our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our 
revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our stock price.
• Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs 
and expenses.
• Failure to complete the Merger with Juniper Networks may adversely affect our business and our stock 
price.
• Failure to realize the benefits expected from the Merger with Juniper Networks could adversely affect our 
business or our stock price.
• Any failure by us to identify, manage, and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations, divestitures, 
and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
• If we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business, and financial 
performance may suffer.
• In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition key employees, 
and failure to do so could seriously harm us.
• If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial 
performance could suffer.
• Issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm, liability or impact 
to our results of operations.
• Changes in the macroeconomic environment have, at times, impacted and may in the future negatively 
impact our results of operations.
• Failure to meet responsible and sustainable business expectations or standards or achieve our Living 
Progress goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.
• Risks arising from climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy may impact our business.
Industry Risks
• We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and 
financial performance.
International Risks
• Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory 
regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and 
expenses, and financial condition.
• We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Intellectual Property Risks
17


Page 20:
• Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license, or enforce the intellectual 
property rights on which our businesses depend.
• Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third 
parties.
• Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are commonplace in 
our industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and 
services.
Financial Risks
• Adverse developments affecting our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs, and access to capital 
markets could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations or those of the 
third parties with whom we do business.
• Our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay 
dividends.
• The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial 
results less predictable.
• Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult 
and future financial results less predictable.
• We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial 
Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of 
operations.
• Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, to holders of our shares will be uncertain.
Regulatory and Government Risks
• Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in 
costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.
• Contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governments are subject to a number of challenges and 
risks that may adversely impact our business.
• Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional 
tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.
Risks Related to Prior Separations
• The stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services 
business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC Technology 
Company or Micro Focus International plc (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us 
for any such tax liability imposed on us.
• We continue to face a number of risks related to our separation from HP Inc., our former parent, including 
those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our financial 
condition and results of operations, and shared use of certain intellectual property rights, which could in the 
future adversely impact our reputation.
General Risks
• Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock 
difficult to predict.
For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.
Business and Operational Risks 
If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, including offering our entire portfolio as-a-
Service, our business, operating results, and financial performance may suffer.
  Our long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware, software, and services as we 
deliver global edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from 
all of their data, everywhere. We provide our entire portfolio through a range of subscription and consumption-
based, pay-per-use, and aaS offerings. We will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital 
expenditure and license-based model, giving our customers choices in consuming HPE products and services. 
18


Page 21:
Furthermore, subject to our anticipated consummation of the acquisition of Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper 
Networks”) (the “Merger”), we will seek to offer secure, unified cloud- and AI-native networking to enhance 
innovation across edge to cloud. To successfully execute on these strategic pillars, we must continue to improve 
cost structures, align sales coverage with strategic goals, improve channel execution, and strengthen our 
capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our 
strategic capabilities in areas such as edge computing, hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, data center networking, 
network security, and high-performance compute. We must make sufficient long-term investments in strategic 
growth areas, such as developing, obtaining, and protecting appropriate intellectual property, and commit or 
transition significant R&D and other resources before knowing whether our projections will reasonably reflect 
customer demand for our solutions. Should such efforts fail to produce actionable insights, or our offerings not 
perform as designed or promised, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
Furthermore, such incremental capital requirements may negatively impact cash flows in the near term and may 
require us to dedicate additional resources, including sales and marketing costs.
The process of improving our HPE GreenLake cloud offerings, enhancing existing hardware, software, and 
cloud-based solutions, and developing and improving the systems necessary for new and evolving data-intensive 
artificial intelligence-based workloads are all complex, costly, and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate 
customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately, to invest sufficiently in strategic growth 
areas, or to otherwise successfully execute this strategy could significantly harm our market share, results of 
operations, and financial performance.
Having developed a cloud platform product in HPE GreenLake and the hardware capabilities to support 
artificial intelligence computing, we must be able to continue integrating new features that are relevant to our 
customers and to scale quickly, while also managing costs and preserving margins, which means accurately 
forecasting volumes, mixes of products, and configurations that meet customer requirements, which we may not 
succeed at doing. These offerings face competition from peer companies with their own cloud platform and artificial 
intelligence computing offerings, and any delay in the development, production, or marketing of a new product, 
service, or solution could result in our offerings being late to reach the market, which could harm our competitive 
position. In addition, should we successfully consummate the Merger, the process of integrating and streamlining 
our offerings (including integrating Juniper Networks’ offerings with ours) or developing new solutions based on our 
respective technological portfolios may be complex, costly, time-consuming, and uncertain, and failure by us to 
successfully do so could adversely impact our future results of operations and financial performance. Furthermore, 
we anticipate needing to adapt our go-to-market structure from time to time with new sales and marketing 
approaches, to better align with aaS business models and to capture unique market opportunities, such as in hybrid 
cloud and artificial intelligence. Changing our go-to-market structure may affect employee compensation models 
and ultimately our ability to retain employees. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement these 
adjustments in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits 
from them.
Our HPE GreenLake solutions generally are multiyear agreements, which result in recurring revenue streams 
over the term of the arrangement. As customer demand for our aaS offerings increases, we have experienced, and 
will continue to experience, differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings (for 
which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery) and our aaS offerings (for which revenue is generally 
recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement). As such, our financial results and growth depend, in part, on 
customers continuing to purchase our services and solutions over the contract life on the agreed terms. Additionally, 
implementing this business model also means that our historical results, especially those from before the transition, 
may not be indicative of future results, which may adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast our future 
operating results. Our aaS offerings also could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the provision of 
services as well as operational, technical, legal, regulatory, or other costs.
We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier 
relationships properly. 
Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products, and services, as well 
as our suppliers’ abilities to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products, and services at reasonable 
prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. Given the wide 
variety of solutions that we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and 
the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble, and deliver certain solutions, problems have, from time to 
time in the past, arisen, and could in the future arise, in production, planning, and inventory management that could 
harm our business. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply 
disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of 
our suppliers have at times decided, and may in the future decide, to discontinue conducting business with us. 
19


Page 22:
Other supplier problems that we have faced, and could again face in the future, include component shortages, 
excess supply, and contractual, relational, and labor risks, each of which is described below.
• Component shortages. We have in the past experienced, and may experience again in the future, delays 
and shortages of certain components as a result of strong demand, supplier transitions, raw material or 
capacity constraints, and other problems experienced by suppliers in certain geographies and markets, 
resulting in insufficient supply to meet total market demand. In the past, we have experienced shortages or 
delays, which led to higher prices of certain components and exposure to quality issues and delivery delays, 
which may occur again in the future. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable 
prices, of acceptable quality, or at all, to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the 
quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business and financial performance 
could suffer from a loss of time-sensitive sales, additional freight costs incurred, or the inability to pass on 
price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we may have to 
reengineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.
• Excess supply. In order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make advance 
payments to suppliers or enter into long term agreements, non-cancellable commitments, or other inventory 
management arrangements with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in 
advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of 
future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply can result in 
excess or obsolete components (which has happened at times in the past), which has at times adversely 
impacted and could in the future adversely impact our business and financial performance.
• Contractual terms. As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may 
be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the 
current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to 
purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a 
disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin 
could suffer, and we could incur charges relating to inventory obsolescence.
• Contingent workers. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our 
failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We 
have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could 
face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms 
relating to contingent workers. Our ability to manage the size and cost of our contingent workforce may be 
subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.
• Single-source suppliers. We obtain certain components from single-source suppliers due to technology, 
availability, price, quality, scale, or customization needs. Certain of such suppliers have, in the past decided, 
and may in the future decide, to discontinue manufacturing components used in our products, which may 
cause us to discontinue certain products, incur additional costs to redesign our products so as not to 
incorporate such discontinued components, or incur time and expense to find replacement suppliers. 
Replacing a single-source supplier has at times delayed, and could delay, production of some products as 
replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations. For 
some components, such as customized components, alternative sources either may not exist or may be 
unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In 
addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements 
that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the 
supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers 
under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect 
the quality, quantity, and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of 
our relationship with a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under 
which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and 
financial performance.
System security risks, data protection incidents, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt 
our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our 
revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our stock price. 
As a leading technology firm, we are exposed to attacks from criminals, nation state actors, malicious 
insiders, and activist hackers (collectively, “malicious parties”) who have at times been able to circumvent or bypass 
our cyber security measures. Although some of these attacks have caused disruptions or exposure of information, 
so far, these attacks have not resulted in material negative impacts to HPE, nor have any of HPE’s consumers, 
20


Page 23:
customers, or employees informed HPE that these attacks resulted in material harm to them. While we investigate 
and remediate incidents, there can be no assurance that we will do so comprehensively or that the threat actor will 
not identify alternative means of intrusion or opportunities to otherwise utilize the information it accessed to 
adversely affect our business or results of operations. It is also possible that incidents may embolden other 
malicious actors to perpetrate future attacks that may result in material misappropriation, system disruptions or 
shutdowns, malicious alteration, or destruction of our confidential or personal information or that of third parties. 
Further, there has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of such attacks, and we expect these 
activities to continue to increase, including malicious actors potentially leveraging AI to develop malicious code or 
sophisticated phishing attempts. Malicious parties may also be able to otherwise develop and deploy viruses, 
worms, ransomware, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any 
security vulnerabilities of our products, including within our cloud-based environments and offerings, such that we 
may be unable to anticipate such malicious parties’ techniques, implement adequate preventative measures, or 
remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis even if our security measures are appropriate, reasonable, 
and comply with applicable legal requirements. Further, cyberattacks or incidents have in the past gone, and could 
in the future go, undetected in our environments for a period of time, and we may discover additional impacts of 
earlier incidents that we believe were remediated. For example, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 24, 2024, we learned in December 2023 that, beginning in 
May 2023, a nation-state-associated threat actor gained unauthorized access to and exfiltrated data from HPE’s 
cloud-based email and SharePoint environments. While this incident has been investigated and remediated with no 
material impact experienced by HPE to date, this may have nevertheless resulted in harm to our reputation and 
customer relationships (and may do so in the future, as well), and there can be no assurance that the threat actor 
will not utilize the information accessed to adversely affect our business or results of operations. Given our broad 
and diverse network environment, resource limitations, and operational constraints, we have in the past failed, and 
may in the future fail, to patch certain security vulnerabilities in time to prevent successful disruptions of our 
infrastructure or exposure of information. 
Malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain and the systems or networks of other third 
parties on whom we rely, and as such, may embed malicious software or hardware in our products, thereby 
compromising our customers. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and 
Ukraine or in the Middle East, may heighten the risk of such cyberattacks or exacerbate system vulnerabilities, 
considering our continued hybrid work environment and our globally dispersed operations, employees, contractors, 
suppliers, developers, partners, and other third parties. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system 
software and applications that we produce, procure or integrate from third parties, including those of companies we 
have acquired, may contain defects in design or manufacturing, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere 
with the operation of the system. The costs associated with cybersecurity tools and infrastructure and competition 
for cybersecurity and IT talent have at times limited, and may in the future limit, our ability and the ability of third 
parties on whom we rely to efficiently identify, eliminate, or remediate cyber or other security vulnerabilities or 
problems or enact changes to minimize the attack surface of our network. Furthermore, our efforts, and the efforts of 
third parties on whom we rely, to address these problems, at times, have not been, and may in the future not be 
successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, compromise of sensitive information, and 
loss of existing or potential customers, any of which may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other 
critical functions. Additional impacts from cybersecurity incidents could include reimbursement of remediation costs 
to our customers, suppliers, or distributors, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system 
damage, and incentives for continued business; lost revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary 
information or the failure to retain or attract business partners following an incident; increased insurance premiums; 
and damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value. Further, it may be difficult to 
determine the best way to investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate any harm caused by a cybersecurity 
incident. Such efforts may not be successful, and we may make errors or fail to take necessary actions. It may take 
considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. 
These factors may inhibit our ability to provide prompt, full, and reliable information about the incident to our 
customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Additionally, to the extent we carry insurance coverage for such 
possibilities, we cannot be certain that any such coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to 
claims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising 
from security breaches or incidents, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all.
We manage and store various proprietary information, intellectual property, and sensitive or confidential data 
relating to our business. In addition, our business may process, store, and transmit customer data, including 
commercially sensitive, government-related, and/or personal data, subject to the European General Data Protection 
Regulation, United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, and various U.S. state and foreign data security 
and privacy laws, which give new data privacy rights to their residents and impose significant obligations related to 
21


Page 24:
the handling of personal data. Compliance with data security and privacy laws is complex and costly. With our 
business increasingly providing aaS offerings, malicious parties could target such services, potentially resulting in 
an increased risk of compromise of customer or employee data resulting in regulatory exposure. Incidents involving 
our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination 
of proprietary information, intellectual property, or sensitive, confidential, or personal data about us, our clients, or 
our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such data as a result of fraud or other forms of 
deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information; 
result in regulatory fines, litigation, and potential liability for us; damage our brand and reputation; or otherwise harm 
our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other IT solutions or incur significant 
expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our 
products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of managing an incident and 
implementing further data protection measures could be significant.
Additionally, we have at times experienced, and may experience, other security issues that are not the results 
of any action or attack from malicious parties, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system 
errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. Portions of our IT infrastructure also have experienced, and 
may experience, interruptions, delays, or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems 
integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. As our IT environment continues to evolve, we have, 
at times, been unsuccessful, and may in the future be unsuccessful, in adopting or implementing new systems and 
transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive, and 
resource intensive. Furthermore, our data centers depend on predictable and reliable energy and networking 
capabilities, the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected or disrupted by a variety of factors, including 
but not limited to the effects of climate change. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders 
and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins, or lost customers 
resulting from these events could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our reputation 
and stock price.
While we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our products, services, IT systems, controls, and 
software that could be exploited by any malicious parties, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we 
have at times failed, and may fail, to anticipate, detect, identify, and/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are 
exploited or such vulnerabilities may persist after issuing security patches because system software updates may 
occur asynchronously across our customer base. Additionally, we have acquired and may continue to acquire 
companies with cybersecurity vulnerabilities or different security standards, which exposes us to related 
cybersecurity, operational, and financial risks. Further, as our products and services in some instances are 
integrated with our customers' systems and processes, even if we are successful in identifying vulnerabilities, a 
successful attack on us could compromise customers’ IT systems and sensitive data, despite active monitoring and 
development of tools designed to identify and remediate such vulnerabilities. There is no guarantee that a series of 
issues may not be determined to be material in the aggregate at a future date even if they may not be material 
individually at the time of their occurrence.
Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our 
costs and expenses.  
Our worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or human-induced disasters 
including, but not limited to, earthquakes; tsunamis; floods; hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons; fires; other extreme 
weather conditions; power or water shortages; telecommunications failures; materials scarcity and price volatility; 
terrorist acts, civil unrest, conflicts or wars; and health epidemics or pandemics. The impacts and frequency of any 
of the above could be further exacerbated by climate change, particularly in countries where we operate that have 
limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources. While we are predominantly self-insured to mitigate the 
impact of most catastrophic events, the occurrence of business disruptions could, among other impacts, harm our 
revenue, profitability, and financial condition; adversely affect our competitive position; increase our costs and 
expenses; make it difficult or impossible to provide our offerings to our customers or to receive components from our 
suppliers; create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain; or require substantial expenditures and recovery time 
in order to fully resume operations.
Public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures taken in response to such events 
have in the past negatively impacted, and may again in the future negatively impact, our operations and workforce, 
as well as those of our partners, customers and suppliers. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of such 
events have, from time to time, caused increased volatility in financial and other capital markets, adversely 
impacting our stock price, our ability to access the capital markets, and our ability to fund liquidity needs, and may 
do so again in the future. The negative impacts of any such events on business operations and demand for our 
22


Page 25:
offerings will depend on future developments and actions taken in response to such events, which may be outside 
our control, highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time.
The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are 
concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the United States, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, 
Malaysia, Mexico, China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore. We also rely on major logistics hubs, which are 
strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to HPE’s distribution 
channels and customers. Other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and 
Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. Our operations could be adversely affected if 
manufacturing, logistics, or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including those 
enumerated above, as they have been in the past by natural disasters and public health issues in the United States, 
Puerto Rico, and China. To the extent such disruptions adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial 
condition, and stock price, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this 
Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.
Failure to complete the Merger with Juniper Networks may adversely affect our business and our stock 
price.
In January 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Juniper Networks, Inc., a leader in AI-
native networks. Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including 
but not limited to (i) the adoption of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among 
Juniper Networks, HPE and Jasmine Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary 
of HPE (“Merger Sub”), by Juniper Networks’ stockholders (which was completed on April 2, 2024); (ii) the absence 
of any injunction, order or law preventing, prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger; (iii) the 
expiration or termination of the waiting period (or extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of all other required approvals, consents or clearances 
under specified foreign antitrust laws and foreign investment laws without imposition of a Burdensome Condition (as 
defined in the Merger Agreement); and (iv) in the case of the obligations of HPE and Merger Sub to effect the 
Merger, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to Juniper Networks that is continuing as of the 
closing. There can be no assurance that these or other closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at 
all. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits when 
expected, if at all. If the Merger is not completed, our stock price could be impacted to the extent it reflects an 
assumption that we will complete the Merger, and additionally, we may suffer other consequences that could 
adversely affect our business, results of operations, and stock price, including incurring significant acquisition costs 
that we would be unable to recover, negative publicity, and a negative impression of us in the investment 
community. Furthermore, under certain specified circumstances, including the termination of the Merger Agreement 
by either us or Juniper Networks because certain required regulatory clearances are not obtained or the terms of 
the Merger Agreement are materially breached by us, upon termination we would be required to pay Juniper 
Networks a termination fee of $815 million.
Failure to realize the benefits expected from the Merger with Juniper Networks could adversely affect our 
business or our stock price.
There can be no assurance that we will realize any of the significant benefits that we expect to result from the 
Merger, or realize them within the anticipated timeframe. Achieving these benefits will depend, in part, on our ability 
to integrate Juniper Networks’ business successfully and efficiently. The challenges involved in this integration, 
which will be complex and time-consuming, include the following:
• preserving customer and other important relationships of Juniper Networks and attracting new business and 
operational relationships;
• integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
• consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures;
• coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities;
• coordinating and integrating operations, including in countries in which we have not previously operated; 
and
• integrating employees and related human capital management systems and benefits, maintaining employee 
morale and retaining key employees.
If we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired 
business, then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger on our anticipated timeframe or at all, and 
our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. 
23


Page 26:
The successful integration of Juniper Networks will require significant management attention both before and after 
the completion of the Merger with Juniper Networks, and may divert the attention of management from our business 
and operational issues.
Any failure by us to identify, manage, and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations, divestitures, 
and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
As part of our strategy, we may acquire businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances 
and joint ventures, and make investments to further our business (collectively, “business combination and 
investment transactions”), and also handle any post-closing issues, such as integration. Risks associated with 
business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our 
financial results, including our effective tax rate:
• We may not successfully combine product or service offerings or realize all of the anticipated benefits of any 
particular business combination and investment transaction, which may result in (1) failure to execute on 
our business strategy; (2) failure to coordinate sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our 
capabilities; (3) failure to retain employees, customers, distributors, and suppliers or attract new business 
and operational relationships; (4) increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations 
which may cause financial results to differ from expectations; and (5) pay, early retirement costs, employee 
benefit costs, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, 
assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments 
to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.
• We may fail to successfully and efficiently (1) integrate financial forecasting and controls, procedures and 
reporting cycles; (2) consolidate and integrate corporate, information technology, finance and administrative 
infrastructures; (3) coordinate and integrate operations, including in countries in which we have not 
previously operated;  (4) integrate employees and related human capital management systems and 
benefits; or (5) address redundant processes and functions in an adequate manner (thereby impacting our 
ability to achieve all or any of the anticipated synergies)
• Our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and 
our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of 
statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives. We may fail to 
identify significant issues with the acquired company’s product quality, financial disclosures, workplace 
culture, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate 
reasonably accurate costs, timing and other matters.
• In order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, 
potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements, which 
could affect our liquidity and financial condition.
• For an acquisition or other combination, the acquisition partner may have differing or inadequate 
cybersecurity and data protection controls, which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and 
potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business.
• Business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial 
condition and results of operations.
• We have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of 
certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and, to the 
extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination 
and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges 
relating to the impairment of those assets.
• For a divestiture, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable 
terms in a timely manner, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable 
than we had anticipated.
• The impact of divestitures on our revenue growth may be larger than projected, as we may experience 
greater dis-synergies than expected. If we do not satisfy pre-closing conditions and necessary regulatory 
and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, it may prevent us from completing the transaction. 
Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through 
continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these 
arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could 
affect our future financial results.
24

• Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise if our Board of Directors deems it to be undesirable. Provisions such as indemnification, 
meeting requirements, and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy 
contests, or changes in control or management of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
Management’s attention or other resources may be diverted during business combination and investment 
transactions and may be further impacted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and 
investment transactions that further our strategic objectives . See also the risk factors below under the heading 
“Risks Related to Prior Separations.”
If we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business, and financial 
performance may suffer. 
In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our 
products, services, and solutions (whether developed by us or by a company we acquire), including defects in our 
engineering, design, and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well 
as defects in third-party components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious 
acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. In order to address quality issues, we work 
extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems 
and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the products, services, and solutions that we offer 
are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all 
quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we are 
unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or “patch”) to address quality 
issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which could delay revenue recognition and receipt 
of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, and profitability. In addition, after 
products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing quality issues 
can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement, and other costs, adversely affecting 
our financial performance. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with 
our services or solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if 
we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues, including the actual or perceived security or 
reliability of our offerings or ability to address other data security concerns, can impair our relationships with new or 
existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our results of 
operations.
In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition key employees, 
and failure to do so could seriously harm us. 
In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition qualified executives 
and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing, and IT positions. 
In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a 
competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. These are particularly 
important considering our growth strategy to capture the market opportunities presented by networking, hybrid 
cloud, and AI. Certain equity-based incentive awards for certain executives contain conditions relating to our stock 
price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If 
the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation 
otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being 
competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive 
awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key 
employees could be weakened.
Our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key 
employees could have a significant impact on our operations and our ability to execute our strategy. Further, 
changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and 
assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As 
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry has grown increasingly intense, we have in the past 
experienced, and may in the future experience, higher than anticipated levels of employee attrition, which has 
resulted in increased costs to hire new employees with the desired skills and may do so again in the future. In 
addition, significant or prolonged turnover or revised hiring priorities may negatively impact our operations and 
culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of 
historical, technical, and other expertise. These risks to attracting and retaining the necessary talent may be 
exacerbated by labor constraints, such as immigration policies which may impair the ability to recruit technical and 
professional talent, and inflationary pressures, which impact employee wages and benefits. Further, integration of 
25


Page 28:
employees and businesses as a result of our acquisitions, including the Merger, may present challenges, which 
could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial 
performance could suffer. 
 We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including both 
direct and indirect sales to end-users. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel 
efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, 
since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous 
balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins 
and therefore our profitability.
Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the 
financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by 
any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or 
distribution arrangement. Moreover, some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources 
and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry 
consolidation, and market trends. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit 
insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we 
could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors’ financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the 
credit markets, or operations weaken.
Our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through 
distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to 
distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors have in the past adjusted orders 
during periods of product shortages, and may do so in the future, in addition to cancelling orders if their inventory is 
too high or delaying orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to 
the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. If we 
have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, and have done so 
from time to time in the past. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to 
adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes.  
Issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm, liability or 
impact to our results of operations.
We believe the proliferation of AI, especially as it relates to our products and solutions that enable AI 
workloads, will have a significant impact on customer preferences and market dynamics in our industry, and our 
ability to effectively compete in this space will be critical to our financial performance. We currently incorporate AI 
capabilities into certain offerings and manufacture hardware designed to support AI capabilities, and our research 
into and continued development of such capabilities and manufacturing processes remain ongoing. We have 
invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources to build and support the development of these 
capabilities and manufacturing processes, and if our AI-related offerings fail to operate as anticipated or as well as 
competing offerings or otherwise do not meet customer needs or if we are unable to bring AI-related offerings to 
market as effectively as our competitors, we may fail to recoup our investments in AI, our competitive position may 
be harmed, and our business and reputation may be adversely impacted.
As with many innovations, AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect its 
adoption, and therefore our business and our overall strategy. While we review proposed implementations and use 
cases ahead of deployment, we may not always identify the risks or deficiencies of an AI capability or offering and 
the market may respond differently than we anticipate, potentially impacting our results of operations. AI algorithms 
and training methodologies may be flawed. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us 
or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. 
These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal 
liability, and brand or reputational harm. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their 
impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience 
competitive, brand, or reputational harm or legal and/or regulatory action. Further, incorporating AI gives rise to 
litigation risk and risk of non-compliance and unknown cost of compliance, as AI is an emerging technology for 
which the legal and regulatory landscape is not fully developed and which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, 
creating complex compliance issues (including potential liability for breaching intellectual property or privacy rights 
or laws or for the misuse of personal data). While new AI initiatives, laws, and regulations are emerging and 
evolving, what they ultimately will look like remains uncertain, and our obligation to comply with them could entail 
significant costs, negatively affect our business, or entirely limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into 
26


Page 29:
our offerings. The resulting impact of such regulations on our customers’ desire for AI capabilities and demand for 
our offerings more generally could negatively impact our results of operations.
Additionally, leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve internal functions and operations presents further 
risks and challenges. While we aim to use AI ethically and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical or legal issues 
presented by its use, we may nevertheless be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. The 
use of AI to support business operations carries inherent risks related to data privacy and security, such as 
intended, unintended, or inadvertent transmission of proprietary or sensitive information, as well as challenges 
related to implementing and maintaining AI tools, such as developing and maintaining appropriate datasets for such 
support. Further, dependence on AI without adequate safeguards to make certain business decisions may introduce 
additional operational vulnerabilities by impacting our relationships with customers, partners, and suppliers; by 
producing inaccurate outcomes based on flaws in the underlying data; or other unintended results.
Changes in the macroeconomic environment have, at times, impacted and may in the future negatively 
impact our results of operations.
Changes in macroeconomic conditions have, at times, affected and may in the future affect consumer and 
enterprise spending, and as a result, our customers have postponed or cancelled, and may also in the future 
postpone or cancel, spending in response to numerous reasons, including but not limited to volatility in credit and 
equity markets, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, all of which may have an 
adverse effect on the demand for our products and/or result in changes in our product prices. Other factors that 
have had, and could again in the future have, an adverse effect on demand for our products, financial condition and 
results of operations include inflation, slower economic growth or economic recession, conditions in the labor 
market, healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting 
consumer and business spending behavior. These changes could happen rapidly and we may not be able to react 
quickly to prevent or limit our losses or exposures. Additionally, other macroeconomic developments, such as efforts 
of governments to stimulate or stabilize the economy, international conflicts, trade disputes, sanctions, increased 
tariffs internationally, including between the United States and China and on imports into the United States from 
various countries, have at times impacted, and may in the future impact our business in an adverse manner, 
whether directly or indirectly, such as through their impacts on the financial positions and operations of our 
customers, suppliers, and other third parties with whom we do business or on whom we rely, and as a 
consequence, their ability to perform their obligations under their agreements with us. Persistent inflation has 
negatively affected our business in recent quarters and could do so again in the future, as well. A general 
weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government 
or corporate spending have at times caused current or potential customers to reduce their IT budgets or be unable 
to fund data storage products, which have led them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products or to not 
pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services, all of which may occur again in the 
future.
Failure to meet responsible and sustainable business expectations or standards or achieve our Living 
Progress goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock 
price.
There has been an increased focus from regulators and stakeholders on sustainability and corporate 
responsibility matters. Given our commitment to sustainable and responsible business, we actively manage these 
issues through our Living Progress Strategy and have established and publicly announced certain goals, which we 
may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals reflect our current plans and aspirations, are based on 
available data and estimates, and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Moreover, actions or 
statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently 
believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. 
Initiatives to address sustainability and corporate responsibility issues may be costly and may not have the desired 
effect. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to manage these issues and accomplish our 
goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which may be 
outside of our control or could have adverse impacts on our business, including on our stock price. Further, there is 
uncertainty around the accounting standards and climate-related disclosures associated with emerging laws and 
reporting requirements and the related costs to comply with the emerging regulations.
Our failure or perceived failure to achieve our Living Progress goals, maintain responsible and sustainable 
business practices, or comply with emerging sustainability regulations that meet evolving regulatory or stakeholder 
expectations could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and talent, and 
expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. Our reputation also 
27


Page 30:
may be harmed by the perceptions that our stakeholders have about our action or inaction on certain sustainability- 
and corporate responsibility-related issues, or because they may disagree with our goals and initiatives, either of 
which may cause us to face scrutiny, lawsuits, or other market access restrictions from certain parties related to our 
action or inaction on such issues. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our 
products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial performance, as well as require 
additional resources to rebuild our reputation. 
Risks arising from climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy may impact our business. 
Climate change serves as a risk multiplier that could increase both the frequency and severity of natural 
disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations and those of suppliers and customers. Our corporate 
headquarters is located in Spring, Texas, which suffers from floods, hurricanes, and other extreme weather, and a 
portion of our research and development activities are located in California, which suffers from drought conditions 
and catastrophic wildfires, each affecting the health and safety of our employees. In California, to mitigate wildfire 
risk, electric utilities have, at times periodically deployed, and may in the future, periodically deploy public safety 
power shutoffs, which affect electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities. Certain sites located in the 
United States, Middle East, China, and India experience exposure to extreme heat and water stress, which could 
potentially jeopardize the health and well-being of our employees, consequently impacting our operations. While we 
seek to mitigate business risks, including those associated with climate change, through site selection, infrastructure 
technological investments, business continuity planning, and robust environmental programs, this may require us to 
incur substantial costs, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so as there are inherent climate-related risks 
wherever business is conducted. Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of 
insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity 
of such natural disasters.
The increasing concern over climate change could also result in transition risks, such as efforts and 
expenditures related to carbon abatement, shifting customer preferences, or compliance risks from changing 
regulatory and legal requirements. We have already observed changing customer preferences resulting in 
increased demands for sustainable solutions, products, and services. While we have been integrating such trends 
into our business and sales strategies thus far, we may not be able to successfully do so in the future. Further, 
continually changing customer preferences may cause us to incur additional costs, invest more in R&D, or make 
other changes to other operations to respond to such demands, which may not be carried out successfully, and if 
so, could adversely affect our financial results. We may also confront higher electricity prices as the grid 
decarbonizes, and higher costs for supplies or components that comply with certain environmental regulatory 
thresholds, potentially impacting our margins or the pricing of our offerings. If we fail to manage these and other 
transition risks in an effective manner, customer demand for our solutions, products, and services could diminish, 
and our profitability could suffer.
Industry Risks 
We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and 
financial performance. 
Our ability to implement solutions for our customers, anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes 
in technology (such as cloud-, AI-, and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving), and develop new 
service offerings or incorporate technological improvements into our offerings that meet current and prospective 
customers’ needs, as well as evolving industry standards, is critical to our competitiveness and success. We 
encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our 
competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete primarily 
on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of 
products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, 
security, and the availability of our IT infrastructure offerings. If our products, services, support, and cost structure do 
not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our results of operations and business 
prospects could be harmed.
We have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial, personnel, and other 
resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or 
specialize in one or more of our product or service lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our 
business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and marketing 
resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against 
theirs. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies, successfully adapt to industry developments and 
changing demand, and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the 
demands of the markets we serve, we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and 
28


Page 31:
execute on our growth strategy, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial 
condition. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous, and potentially 
stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our competitors may affect our business by 
entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers.
Companies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in 
other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships 
with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these 
complicated relationships with vertical partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We face aggressive price competition and may continue to do so. As a consequence of inflation and higher 
supply chain and manufacturing costs, we have in the past increased the prices of many of our products and 
services to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin, and may do so again in the future. In addition, 
competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can 
obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and 
components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash 
flows, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide 
pricing pressures.
Because our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products and services, we 
may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on R&D than some of our competitors. If we cannot 
proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from R&D expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive 
price pressures, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our 
offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose 
market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.
Even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance 
could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is 
becoming obsolete. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products 
that perform similar functions as our offerings.
International Risks 
Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory 
regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and 
expenses, and financial condition. 
Our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the 
demand for technology hardware, software, and services in, and continued access to, the markets in which we 
compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty and the volatile inflationary environment have constrained spending 
on network and enterprise infrastructure. This has in the past adversely affected the demand for our products, 
services, and solutions, which has impacted our financial condition and results of operations, all of which we may 
experience again in the future. These have, at times in the past, resulted in increased expenses due to higher 
allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges (among other financial 
impacts), and made it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross 
margin, cash flows, and expenses, and may have such effects again in the future. Such factors, including how long 
such conditions may persist, among others, may negatively impact the evenness or volume of demand for our 
products and services, potentially resulting in impacts similar to those mentioned above, though the precise extent 
of such impacts cannot be accurately predicted.
Economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any 
financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, or any significant financial services institution 
failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate 
rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. Interest and other expenses have varied, and 
could continue to vary, materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, 
currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities, and the fair value of derivative instruments. It is difficult to 
predict the impact of such events on us, our third-party partners, our customers, or economic markets more broadly, 
which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in 
response to macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Such actions have impacted, and may 
further impact our ability, desire, or the timing of seeking funding for various investment opportunities. Economic 
downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. Further, reduced U.S. federal 
government spending may limit demand for our products, services, and solutions from organizations that receive 
29

funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, 
which could further reduce demand for our products, services, and solutions.
Our business and financial performance also could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. trade policy, 
U.S. export controls and sanctions, and U.S. regulations concerning imports, as well as international laws and 
regulations relating to global trade. Current U.S. government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain 
foreign goods, including information and communication technology products. These measures have materially 
increased costs for certain goods imported into the United States. As a result, our business has in the past been 
impacted by forced material price increases, which in turn resulted in price increases for our offerings, which 
subsequently limited demand or reduced margins for our offerings, all of which may impact us again from time to 
time in the future. Additionally, U.S. trading partners may adopt their own trade policies making it more difficult or 
costly for us to export our products to those countries. Similarly, changes in regulations relating to certain exports, 
including economic sanctions, have led to export delays and prevented us, and could in the future prevent us, from 
exporting products to certain locations or customers entirely, which have in some instances impacted, and could in 
the future impact, our financial performance. In addition, changes in requirements relating to making foreign direct 
investments could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to 
particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating 
costs, or lead to penalties or restrictions. While we have policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance 
with global trade laws and regimes around the world, such measures may not guarantee compliance.
Sales outside the United States constituted approximately 64% of our net revenue in fiscal 2024. As such, our 
future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors in addition to those 
otherwise already disclosed, including:
• ongoing uncertainties as a result of instability or changes in geopolitical conditions, including military or 
political conflicts, such as those caused by the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or in the 
Middle East (the potential escalation or geographic expansion of which could heighten other risks identified 
in this report), or the relationship between China and the U.S. (which could, among other things, impact the 
enforceability of certain contracts or the timing and form of certain payments);
• inflationary pressures, which have in the past increased, and may in the future increase costs for materials, 
supplies, and services, including those of third parties with whom we do business;
• adverse or uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including a changing interest rate environment and fears 
of a potential global economic downturn or recession, which have at times in the past slowed customer 
demand for our products and services, and may do so again in the future;
• network security, privacy, and data sovereignty concerns, which could make foreign customers reluctant to 
purchase products and services from U.S.-based technology companies;
• longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers, which could impact our ability to collect 
on accounts receivable and consequently recognize revenue;
• local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and OEMs, or 
changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and 
professional talent;
• managing our geographically dispersed workforce, which has necessitated, and may in the future require, 
incurring costs to promote seamless workforce connectivity and to comply with changing laws, regulations 
and workers’ rights councils across multiple jurisdictions;
• differing technology standards or customer requirements, which have required us to incur additional 
development and production costs to modify or adapt our offerings, and may do so again in the future;
• local content and manufacturing requirements, which have impacted, and could further impact, our ability to 
sell into those markets;
• difficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries, and changes in tax laws, which 
introduces uncertainty to our results of operations and financial performance; and
• fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the 
transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products 
and shipments, which have from time to time adversely impacted, and any of which could in the future 
adversely impact, our results of operations and ability to meet customer demand.
Certain of the factors described above have, in the past, disrupted the operations of, and adversely 
impacted our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers, customers, or vendors located outside of 
30


Page 33:
the United States, and could do so again in the future. For example, we rely on suppliers in Asia for product 
assembly and manufacture, the operations of whom are subject to local labor laws and other requirements. Any loss 
of or limitations on their output or their inability to operate could have an adverse effect on our ability to timely 
deliver our products and services, which would in turn negatively impact our financial performance.
Further, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the trade sanctions imposed by the U.S., the 
European Union (the “EU”), and other countries in response have negatively impacted business and financial 
performance in that region. HPE is continuing to execute on the exit of our remaining business in Russia and 
Belarus as planned; however, we cannot provide any assurance that such exit will be efficient or uninterrupted, 
which may negatively impact our operational expenses.
We implement policies, procedures, and training designed to facilitate compliance with anti-corruption laws 
around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. However, such 
measures may not guarantee compliance, and our employees and third parties with whom we work may take 
actions in violation of such policies or such anti-corruption laws. Furthermore, in many foreign countries, particularly 
in those with developing economies, people may engage in business practices prohibited by anti-corruption laws. 
Violations of such laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and we may be subject to 
those and other liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial 
condition.
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen, and 
British pound has, from time to time, adversely impacted, and could in the future, have an adverse impact on our 
results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and 
services in impacted jurisdictions. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have, from time to time, 
adversely affected, and could in future periods adversely affect our revenue recognition and our revenue growth. In 
addition, currency variations can adversely affect our ability to implement price increases, margins on sales of our 
products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components 
obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.
From time to time, we use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against 
foreign currency exchange rate risks, and may continue to do so in the future. The effectiveness of our hedges 
depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of 
uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant losses 
from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our 
hedging activities may be ineffective, may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion 
of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also 
may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition. 
Intellectual Property Risks 
Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license, or enforce the intellectual 
property rights on which our businesses depend. 
We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws in the United 
States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers, and other parties, 
to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide, or otherwise use 
in our operations. However, from time to time our intellectual property rights have been challenged, infringed, or 
circumvented, and any of such rights could be further challenged, invalidated, infringed, or circumvented or such 
intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to 
otherwise provide competitive advantages. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to 
the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our 
proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect 
our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position. Furthermore, changes in intellectual property 
laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert our intellectual property rights, increase costs 
and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions, and diminish the value 
and competitive advantage conferred by our intellectual property assets.
Monitoring and detecting any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our intellectual property is complex, 
and we cannot be certain that the protective measures we have implemented will completely prevent misuse. Our 
ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks and uncertainty as to the protection and 
enforceability of those rights in some countries. If we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be 
subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against us, 
which could have a negative impact on our business. Effective protection of intellectual property rights is expensive 
31


Page 34:
and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, as well as the costs of defending and 
enforcing those rights.
Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third 
parties. 
Much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third 
parties. For example, many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual 
property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open-source licenses. These third-party 
software components may become obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future versions of our products, our 
relationship with the third party may deteriorate or cease, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be 
terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of 
inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully 
monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source 
license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or 
on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are 
acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on 
favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of 
operations. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, we may acquire intellectual 
property subject to licensing obligations to third parties, other third parties may obtain licenses to some of our 
intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such 
transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third 
parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will 
either refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our 
competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or 
we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.
Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are commonplace in 
our industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and 
services. 
Third parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon or otherwise violating their 
intellectual property rights. Patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose 
of extracting infringement settlements. Furthermore, our exposure to these risks associated with the use of 
intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions; not only do we have a lower level of visibility into 
the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks, 
but also third parties may make infringement and similar claims only after we have acquired technology that had not 
been asserted prior to our acquisition. If we cannot license, or replace, allegedly infringed intellectual property on 
reasonable terms, our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, there is uncertainty around the validity 
and enforceability of intellectual property rights related to our use, development, and deployment of AI and AI 
systems and solutions. Our use of AI technologies, whether created by us for internal or customer use cases or 
otherwise incorporated from external sources into our offerings, could lead to violation of third-party intellectual 
property rights, and could require us to incur significant expenses to modify our solutions and processes or 
otherwise engage in efforts to remain in compliance with the law. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims 
are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management's attention 
and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to 
redesign affected products, discontinue certain product offerings, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, 
pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing, or 
selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying 
party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.
Financial Risks
Adverse developments affecting our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs, and access to capital 
markets could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations or those of the 
third parties with whom we do business.
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's 
Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings Services. Despite these investment grade credit ratings at this time, we may 
experience downgrades in our credit ratings for various reasons, including but not limited to for reasons in 
connection with the substantial amount of debt we have incurred and expect to assume in connection with the 
Merger. Any such downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, 
jeopardize our ability to incur debt on terms acceptable to us, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper, or 
32


Page 35:
require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. Additionally, increased borrowing costs, 
including those arising from a credit rating downgrade, can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing 
business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or 
anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under 
review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position, and access to capital markets.
In addition, volatility and disruption in the financial sector and capital markets and other events negatively 
affecting macroeconomic conditions or contributing to the instability or volatility thereof, such as changing interest 
rates, have from time to time in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our liquidity, capital position, and 
access to capital markets. Our total liquidity depends in part on the availability of funds under the revolving credit 
facility and our other financing agreements. The failure of any lender's ability to fund future draws on our revolving 
credit facility or our other financing arrangements could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations 
and additional capital for future needs. The future effects of such events are unknown and difficult to predict at this 
time, and could adversely affect us, our customers, financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or others with 
which we do business, which may in turn have adverse impacts on our current and/or projected business 
operations, financial condition, and our results of operations.
Our obligation to consummate the Merger is not subject to a financing condition, and as such, may be subject 
to events beyond our control, such as the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals. Further, portions of our recently 
issued debt contain special mandatory redemption provisions, and if we do not consummate the Merger before 
October 2025, we may be required to redeem certain series of such debt, which would result in less flexibility to 
address other funding needs.
Our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay 
dividends. 
In addition to our current total carrying debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. In order 
to consummate the Merger, we have incurred a substantial amount of debt, and plan to incur further debt, as well. 
This collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including 
requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments; making it 
more difficult to satisfy other obligations; increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which 
could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; increasing our vulnerability to 
general adverse economic and industry conditions; reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures 
and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes 
in our business and industry; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of 
business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock.
While the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun lowering interest rates and signaled its intention to keep doing so, 
macroeconomic circumstances may change, resulting in delays or reversal of such actions, including by central 
banks around the world, which may result in a prolonged high interest rate environment and affect our ability to incur 
debt at reasonable prices or our desire to incur further debt at all. To the extent that we incur additional 
indebtedness, the risks described above could increase, including requiring additional expected cash flows from 
operations to service our debt. In addition, our actual cash requirements to operate our business in the future may 
be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to 
repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise 
raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.
The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial 
results less predictable. 
Our revenue, gross margin, and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups, and 
geographic markets and therefore, will likely be different in future periods than our historical results. Our revenue 
depends on the overall demand for our products and services, which is difficult to accurately predict, varies from 
time to time, may be uneven across our portfolio of offerings, and is subject to industry-wide or broader 
macroeconomic market dynamics, all of which have in the past adversely impacted, and may again in the future 
adversely impact, our business and financial condition. Additionally, the varying sizes of customer contracts or 
orders, variations in customer acceptances of delivered orders, the timing thereof, and cancellations and/or de-
bookings of such orders (due to various reasons, including but not limited to failure to satisfy terms and compliance 
matters, whether initiated by us or the customer) can be uneven across our portfolio and have at times impacted, 
and in the future could impact, our pipeline, bookings and our ability to recognize revenue, if at all (particularly with 
respect to contracts and orders involving our AI offerings). Such variables have in the past negatively impacted our 
financial performance, and may do so again in the future. Delays or reductions in discretionary IT spending by our 
customers or potential customers have had, and in the future could have a material adverse effect on demand for 
33


Page 36:
our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. For example, we have seen 
demand soften unevenly across our portfolio and geographies, which may continue, as certain customers and 
sectors have been taking longer than anticipated to digest prior large orders. In addition, revenue declines in some 
of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall 
gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, service, customer, and 
geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue.
Furthermore, the relationship between China and the U.S., and any subsequent action that may be taken by 
either country, may significantly vary the results our operations and financial performance from that region. There 
could be additional uncertainty surrounding the enforceability of contract obligations, as well as the timing and form 
of payments from China. 
Competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to 
pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions, and other risks affecting our businesses may have a 
significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Variations in our fixed cost structure and gross 
margins across business units and product portfolios, have from time to time led to, and may lead to significant 
operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. In addition, newer geographic market 
opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and 
local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure 
necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, 
competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts, 
and other factors have from time to time resulted in, and may in the future result in, reductions in revenue or 
pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. 
Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our 
financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from 
period to period. 
Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult 
and future financial results less predictable. 
In some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a 
disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales 
pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations, and working capital for each financial period 
difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places 
pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than 
orders, there may be excess inventory; and alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may 
not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled, all of which we 
experienced from time to time in the past and may do so again in the future. Depending on when they occur in a 
quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages, or global 
logistics disruptions, have in the past adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact, our inventory 
levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected. 
We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also have produced, and may in the future 
produce, variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. Many of the factors that create and affect 
seasonal trends are beyond our control. 
Separately, periodic supply chain shortages and constraints have, in some instances, resulted in, and may 
result in, increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we have, at times, not been able to, and 
may, in the future, not be able to pass on to our customers. We have, in some instances, responded to such 
constraints by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to 
secure manufacturing capacity, components to fulfill orders, or both. While these measures have been taken to 
shorten lead times to deliver products to customers, they may also result in excess or obsolete components in the 
future if the demand for our products is less than we anticipate or orders are cancelled, which could adversely affect 
our business and financial performance. 
We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial 
Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of 
operations. 
In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and 
assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described 
in the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In 
addition, as discussed in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Use of Estimates” 
and Note 17, “Litigation, Contingencies, and Commitments” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of 
34


Page 37:
Part II, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other 
contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, 
they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates 
and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations. 
Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, to holders of our shares will be uncertain.
Our board of directors will have the discretion to determine whether any dividends on our common stock will 
be declared, when dividends, if any, are declared, and the amount of such dividends. We expect that such 
determination would be based on a number of considerations, including our results of operations and capital 
management plans, availability of funds, our access to capital markets, as well as industry practice, and other 
factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
In addition, on September 13, 2024, we issued 30,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series C Mandatory Convertible 
Preferred Stock with a dividend rate of 7.625% per annum on the liquidation preference of $50 per share (the 
“Preferred Stock”). The Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. 
As long as any share of Preferred Stock is outstanding, unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the 
Preferred Stock for all preceding dividend periods have been declared and paid in full or declared and set apart for 
payment, we may not declare, pay or set apart for payment any dividends on our common stock or any other class 
or series of stock that ranks junior to the Preferred Stock. Dividends on the Preferred Stock are discretionary and 
cumulative. Holders of Preferred Stock will only receive dividends on their shares when, as and if declared by our 
board of directors. If dividends on the Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or 
more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of Preferred Stock, together as a class with 
holders of any other series of parity stock with like voting rights, will be entitled to vote for the election of two 
additional directors to our board of directors. This right to elect additional directors to our board of directors will 
dilute the representation of our stockholders on our board of directors and may adversely affect the market price of 
our common stock. When quarterly dividends have been declared and set apart for payment in full, the right of the 
holders of Preferred Stock to elect these two additional directors will cease, the terms of office of these two directors 
will forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be reduced accordingly. 
Additional risks related to the Preferred Stock are contained in the prospectus supplement dated September 10, 
2024.
Regulatory and Government Risks 
Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in 
costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
We are subject to various US (federal, state, and local), and foreign laws and regulations. Laws and 
regulations may change in ways that will require us to modify our business model and objectives or affect our 
returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or 
prohibiting them outright. For example, as a result of laws and regulations concerning responsible and sustainable 
business practices, we face increasing complexity related to product design, safety and compliance; the use of 
regulated, hazardous, and scarce materials; the management, movement and disposal of hazardous substances 
and waste; the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to operations and the use of products, 
services, and solutions; the transportation and shipping of products and other materials; supply chain due diligence; 
climate change adaptation and mitigation; greenhouse gas emissions; sustainability-related regulations and 
reporting requirements; and the reuse, recycling and/or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or 
useful life and associated operational or financial responsibility. A significant portion of our hardware revenues come 
from international sales. Any changes to current environmental legal requirements may increase our cost of doing 
business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, U.S., China, India and/or other countries 
proposing or adopting similar environmental legal requirements. In addition, other sustainability reporting-related 
laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed, adopted, and implemented 
throughout the world  If we were to violate or become liable under environmental or certain sustainability-related 
laws or if our products become non-compliant with such laws or market access requirements, it could result in loss 
of market access or limit offerings in those markets or our customers may refuse to purchase our products, and we 
could incur costs or face other sanctions, such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions, fines, 
and/or civil or criminal sanctions. Environmental regulations may also impact the availability and cost of energy or 
emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost of manufacturing and/or the cost of powering 
and cooling owned IT infrastructures.
In addition, our business is subject to an ever-growing number of laws and regulations addressing privacy and 
information security, including the use of AI. In particular, we face an increasingly complex global regulatory 
environment and patchwork of state laws in the U.S., increasing the risks addressing these regulatory requirements 
35


Page 38:
and in responding to potential security and data incidents. The increase in aaS offerings may also be impacted by 
data localization and international data transfer requirements under various privacy laws, including the European 
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Given our significant employee and operational presence in India, the 
Digital Personal Data Protection Act (which was approved in August 2023) has imposed, and may continue to 
impose, additional restrictions and compliance costs on us. Furthermore, the rapid development and deployment of 
tools that leverage AI is also causing governments to consider and implement regulation of AI, even for AI that does 
not pertain to personal data, which is impacting and may further impact the use and incorporation of AI capabilities 
in our offerings and in our customer’s demand for such offerings. We have received inquiries, and may be subject to 
demands, claims, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and additional inquiries (including those from U.S. or foreign 
governmental authorities), relating to AI use cybersecurity and data incidents that we have experienced or may in 
the future experience. If we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or 
security or the use of AI, we could incur substantial costs or be exposed to potential regulatory fines, civil or criminal 
sanctions, third-party claims, and reputational damage. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable 
laws and regulations or other obligations relating to these topics could subject us to liability to our customers, data 
subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could 
damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business, any of which could have an adverse effect 
on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Jurisdictions in which we have significant operations and assets, such as the U.S., China, India, and the E.U., 
each have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies 
including, but not limited to fair competition, tax practices, anti-corruption, anti-trust, responsible sourcing and 
human rights (including the use of conflict minerals), price controls and international trade, which have had and may 
continue to have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.
Contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governments are subject to a number of challenges and 
risks that may adversely impact our business. 
Our contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governmental customers are subject to various 
government procurement laws and regulations, required contract provisions, and other requirements relating to 
contract formation, administration, and performance, as well as local content, manufacturing, information security 
and security requirements. Any violation of government contracting laws and regulations or contract terms could 
result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture 
of profits, suspension of payments and fines, treble damages, and suspension from future government contracting. 
Additionally, changes in underlying regulatory requirements that vary across the geographies in which we operate 
could increase compliance costs and risks. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In 
addition, in the US, we will continue to be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the 
government relating to our government contracts. If we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our 
ability to compete for new government contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.
Government contracts impose additional challenges and risks to our sales efforts. Government demand and 
payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding 
authorizations, including in connection with an extended government shutdown, with funding reductions, or delays 
adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services. Such developments could result in material 
payment delays, payment reductions, or contract terminations by our governmental customers, which may impact 
our results of operations and financial condition. These may also adversely impact the results of operations and 
financial condition of government contractors with whom we conduct business. This may cause those government 
contractors to become unable to meet their obligations under contracts with us.
Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional 
tax liabilities could affect our financial performance. 
We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities 
are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding, and 
other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our 
intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a 
result. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts 
ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our 
income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In 
addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by acquisitions, changes to our operating 
structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of 
deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax 
36

return preparation process. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate 
future taxable income. 
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 
countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its 
Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%.  To date, 43 countries have 
enacted portions, or all, of the OECD proposal and a further 22 countries have drafted, or have announced an intent 
to draft, legislation enacting the proposed rules. Where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for us in fiscal 2025. 
Under US GAAP, the OECD Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax, and therefore deferred 
taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. As a result, there 
was no impact to our fiscal 2024 results. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and 
could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. We currently 
do not expect a material impact to our fiscal 2025 results.
During fiscal 2019, we executed a Termination and Mutual Release Agreement which terminated our Tax 
Matters Agreement with HP Inc. Because we now have limited indemnity rights from HP Inc., we potentially bear 
more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments.
Risks Related to Prior Separations 
The stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services 
business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC Technology 
Company or Micro Focus International plc (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us 
for any such tax liability imposed on us. 
The completed separations and mergers of our former Enterprise Services business with DXC Technology 
Company (“DXC”) (the “Everett Transaction” or “Everett”) and our Software Segment with Micro Focus International 
plc (“Micro Focus”) (the “Seattle Transaction” or “Seattle”) were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from 
outside counsel regarding the qualification of (i) the relevant distribution and related transactions as a 
“reorganization” within the meaning of Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the 
“Code”) and (ii) the relevant merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. While 
the Seattle Transaction generally qualified for tax-free treatment for us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, the 
acquisition of Seattle SpinCo by Micro Focus resulted in the recognition of gain (but not loss) for U.S. persons who 
received Micro Focus American Depositary Shares in the Software separation.
Each opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and 
assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us, Everett SpinCo and CSC, or 
us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, as applicable. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, 
or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation 
documents, the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be 
jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinions of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that 
either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, 
assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based 
are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of 
counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.
If the distribution of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, together with certain related 
transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under 
Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock 
of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders 
who receive Everett SpinCo shares or Seattle SpinCo shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if 
they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.
We obtained private letter rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to 
the separation of our Enterprise Services business and Software Segment. Those rulings concluded that certain 
transactions in those separations are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The conclusions of 
the IRS private letter rulings were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized 
and representations we have made to the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, 
inaccurate or incomplete, the validity of the IRS private letter rulings may be affected. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former Enterprise 
Services business and Software Segment, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the completed separation 
of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not 
legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material. If the completed separation of our former Enterprise 
37


Page 40:
Services business or Software Segment (including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those 
separations) are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are 
subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or DXC and/or Micro Focus could incur significant U.S. federal income tax 
liabilities.
We continue to face a number of risks related to our separation from HP Inc., our former parent, including 
those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our financial 
condition and results of operations, and shared use of certain intellectual property rights, which could in 
the future adversely impact our reputation. 
In connection with our separation from HP Inc. on November 1, 2015 (the “Separation”), Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities 
between the companies following the Separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities 
and obligations. In these agreements, HP Inc. agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to 
indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are designed and intended to place financial 
responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations 
and liabilities of HP Inc.'s business with HP Inc. We may be obligated to fully indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities 
under the Separation agreements or HP Inc. may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us 
under the same Separation agreements. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, 
results of operations, and cash flows. 
In addition, the terms of the Separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain 
ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding 
structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of 
the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy 
branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of HP Inc. could also adversely 
affect our reputation. 
General Risks 
Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock 
difficult to predict. 
Investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results 
of operations, or cash flows. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile and can be 
affected by, among other things, speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community; the 
announcement and anticipated timing of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological 
innovations, acquisitions, divestitures, or other significant transactions by us or our competitors; developments in 
our as-a-service business model; our perceived progress in integrating acquired companies; our quarterly financial 
results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us; the financial 
results and business strategies of our competitors; inflation; market volatility or downturns caused by outbreaks, 
epidemics, pandemics, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, or other macroeconomic dynamics; developments relating 
to pending investigations, claims, and disputes; or the timing and amount of our share repurchases. General or 
industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and 
geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. Volatility in the price of our 
securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs 
and the diversion of management time and resources.

ITEM 1C. Cybersecurity.
Risk Management and Strategy 
Our Cybersecurity and Digital Risk Management (“CDRM”) organization, under the leadership of a Global 
Chief Information Security Officer (“Global CISO”), operates a cybersecurity program that is designed to help us 
assess, identify, manage, and mitigate risks relating to cybersecurity threats and incidents. We design our 
cybersecurity standards, policies, processes and controls to operate in an integrated manner, leveraging applicable 
industry standards and security frameworks, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, as guides in supporting 
our ability to perform such functions.  
CDRM manages our cybersecurity program, including by fostering collaboration with partners across business 
units and functional areas to identify and assess material cybersecurity threats, evaluate their severity, and explore 
ways to mitigate and manage such risks. Business units and functional areas are responsible for managing risks 
and implementing our policies and standards within the respective business unit or function. Compliance with our 
policies and standards is assessed by CDRM in conjunction with our internal audit function, through periodic 
cybersecurity audits.  
As part of our cybersecurity program, we maintain a Cyber Risk Management Program that seeks to address 
key risk management concepts, including mission and vision, escalation path for risk mitigation, risk assessments, 
and risk treatment. We do so by conducting a variety of planning and preparedness activities, including employing 
monitoring tools to identify suspicious or anomalous activity, vulnerabilities, or signs of compromise across our 
networks, systems, and data. We utilize data from attack surface management tools to produce a prioritized set of 
vulnerabilities for remediation. We also require mandatory cybersecurity training for employees and periodically 
conduct Company-wide phishing simulations.  
To aide in assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats, our enterprise risk management (“ERM”) 
program incorporates cybersecurity risks as part of its process to assess overall risk of the Company. The ERM 
organization supports management by facilitating a semi-annual risk assessment, which documents the priority and 
status of these risks and aligns them with our strategic mitigation efforts. ERM is structured using a framework 
based on guidance from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission on Enterprise 
Risk Management Integrating Strategy with Performance. 
Within CDRM, our Cybersecurity Defense Center (“CDC”) has established policies, processes, and controls 
that are designed to monitor, detect, investigate, respond to, and escalate management of cybersecurity threats and 
incidents. If we experience a cybersecurity incident, the CDC activates an incident response plan, which includes 
processes to enable us to triage, assess severity of, escalate, contain, investigate, and remediate the incident, as 
well as to comply with applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational harm. Based on initial 
investigation into such incident’s impact to the Company, the actor(s) involved, and other factors, the CDC assigns a 
severity level to an incident, which dictates the escalation path for a given incident. For incidents rising to higher 
levels of severity, the Cyber Governance and Incident Disclosure Committee, a cross-functional committee 
spanning cybersecurity, IT, legal, finance, enterprise risk management, and compliance teams, assesses the 
severity and potential materiality of such incidents and, as appropriate, escalates to designated members of our 
senior management for further assessment, response, and remediation. Additionally, we have established a Cyber 
Crisis Management Team, responsible for addressing and responding to the most severe cyber incidents. If 
warranted, senior management notifies the Audit Committee and/or the full Board of Directors, as appropriate. 
Throughout this process, the CDC continues to investigate the incident and, as its understanding of the incident 
evolves, updates its severity assessment, as necessary. 
We engage third-party security experts, assessors, and consultants, as appropriate, to assess our 
cybersecurity risk management processes; support our ongoing certification efforts; help identify areas for continued 
focus, improvement, and compliance; and support incident response functions, to the extent necessary, all of which 
support our cybersecurity program. From time to time, we conduct third-party-administered, as well as internally 
administered, tabletop exercises, which simulate cybersecurity threats, to assess our existing cybersecurity 
infrastructure and incident response processes. We also periodically conduct offensive security assessments and 
vulnerability tests, and continuously monitor our computing environments to gain visibility into our security posture 
and detect vulnerabilities, abnormalities, or signs of compromise. 
39


Page 42:
In addition to monitoring risks from threats to our own assets, we administer third-party risk management 
practices that endeavor to help identify and manage supply chain and vendor risk arising from some of our key 
suppliers and other service provider organizations. We do so in a variety of ways, such as gathering information on 
third parties’ cybersecurity programs and controls, performing due diligence, undertaking cybersecurity reviews and/
or audits, and/or mandating certain contractual requirements, such as notification of cybersecurity incidents.  
Governance 
Our Global CISO, who reports to our Chief Operating and Legal Officer (“COLO”), has principal management-
level responsibility for our cybersecurity program, which includes assessing and managing our cybersecurity risks, 
along with developing and implementing cybersecurity processes, policies, and controls that are used for managing 
cybersecurity risk across the Company. Our Global CISO is supported by the CISO of Cyber Defense and the CISO 
of Cyber Governance – both of whom have extensive experience in private sector cybersecurity roles – and a team 
of cybersecurity professionals with relevant educational and industry experience. The Global CISO periodically 
meets with the Cyber Governance and Incident Disclosure Committee, our enterprise risk management function and 
chief-level executives to discuss cybersecurity risks, as well as related mitigation and remediation activities. The 
CDC monitors the prevention, detection, investigation, mitigation, response to, and remediation of cybersecurity 
incidents, and regularly reports to our CISO of Cyber Defense, who then subsequently reports to the Global CISO.
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity risk, primarily through the Audit Committee. 
Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors are scheduled to occur at least quarterly 
and annually, respectively, or more frequently, as deemed necessary or advisable. Such presentations to the Audit 
Committee and Board of Directors, as applicable, are made by our COLO and Global CISO and address topics 
such as cybersecurity threats, incidents, risks, results from internal and third-party assessments, progress towards 
risk-mitigation goals, the functioning of our incident response program, and regulatory developments. At times, the 
Audit Committee may receive additional cybersecurity risk reviews from other members of management and/or 
internal cybersecurity experts on certain of our key business segments and products. The Audit Committee regularly 
reports to our Board of Directors regarding the committee’s oversight of such cybersecurity matters. Additionally, the 
COLO and Global CISO may provide ad hoc updates to the Board of Directors and/or the Audit Committee if 
necessitated by a security incident or other significant developments. 
HPE, like all organizations operating in the technology landscape, faces significant and persistent 
cybersecurity risks. To date, no risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity 
incident, have materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 
Notwithstanding our cybersecurity program, we may not be successful in identifying a cybersecurity risk or 
preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident or vulnerability, which if realized, could reasonably likely materially 
affect us. Additional information on the cybersecurity risks we face can be found in the section titled “Risk Factors” 
in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our prior Global CISO departed HPE at the end of October 2024. We have identified a successor, who will join 
HPE in January 2025, previously served in relevant leadership positions at other public and private companies, and 
will bring over two decades of technology experience spanning information security and IT, including serving as 
CISO at other large companies. In the interim, our CDRM organization has been and will be led by our CISO of 
Cyber Defense and CISO of Cyber Governance, both reporting directly to our COLO.

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of 
Equity Securities. 
Market Information
The common stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise is listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker 
symbol “HPE.” 
Holders
As of December 9, 2024, there were 43,102 stockholders of record of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common 
stock.
Dividends
During fiscal 2024, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock to our holders of 
common stock. On December 5, 2024 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock, 
payable on January 16, 2025, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 20, 2024.
We also declared a cash dividend of $0.82604167 per share of our 7.625% Series C Mandatory Convertible 
Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”), which was paid on December 1, 2024, to holders of record as of the close 
of business on November 15, 2024.
The payment of any dividends in the future on shares of our common stock and our Preferred Stock, and the 
timing and amount thereof, is within the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions 
regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital 
requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants in our debt, industry practice, legal requirements, 
regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends will 
depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. 
Furthermore, so long as any share of our Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend on shares of common 
stock (or any other class of stock junior to the Preferred Stock) shall be declared or paid unless all accumulated and 
unpaid dividends for all preceding dividend periods for the Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full in 
cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, or a sufficient sum of cash or number of shares of our 
common stock has been set apart for the payment of such dividends, on all outstanding shares of the Preferred 
Stock. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay a dividend in any future period.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
For purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(“MD&A”) section, we use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to 
refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. 
This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year 
comparisons between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. Discussions of fiscal 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons 
between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part II, Item 7, 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company's Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year October 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on December 22, 2023, which is 
available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information 
that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in certain key items in 
these financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for these changes, as well as 
how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. This 
discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that 
appear elsewhere in this document.
This MD&A is organized as follows:
• Trends and Uncertainties. A discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management, such as 
the mixed macroeconomic environment of supply chain constraints (though easing), uneven demand across 
our portfolio, increased demand for and adoption of new technologies, conservative (though recovering) 
customer spending environment, persistent inflation, foreign exchange pressures, recent tax developments, 
and pending merger with Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper Networks”). 
• Executive Overview. A discussion of our business and a summary of our financial performance and other 
highlights, including non-GAAP financial measures, affecting the Company in order to provide context to the 
remainder of the MD&A.
• Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. A discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we 
believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported 
financial results.
• Results of Operations. A discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a 
discussion of the results of operations at the segment level.
• Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, and 
cash requirements and commitments.
• GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations. Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This section also includes a discussion of the use, usefulness 
and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material 
limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial 
measures.
TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES
During fiscal 2024, the effects of the evolving macroeconomic environment on demand persisted and certain 
significant developments impacted our operations as follows:
Technological Advancements: We have observed market trends and demand (of customers of various 
segments and sizes) gravitating towards artificial intelligence (“AI”), hybrid cloud, edge computing, data security 
capabilities, and related offerings. The volume of data at the edge continues to grow, driven by the proliferation of 
more devices. The need for a unified cloud experience everywhere has grown, as well, in order to manage the 
growth of data at the edge. With the abundance of data, there are opportunities to develop AI tools with powerful 
computational abilities to extract insights and value from the captured data. Increasing demand for AI is also 
contributing to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors and emerging competitors are 
44


Page 47:
expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions and exerting increased 
competitive pressure. We expect these market dynamics and trends to continue in the longer term.
Macroeconomic Uncertainty: The effect of the evolving macroeconomic environment has been impacting 
industry-wide demand, as customers take longer to work through prior orders and have been adopting a more 
conservative approach to discretionary IT spending. This has resulted in uneven demand across our portfolio and 
geographies, particularly for certain of our hardware offerings, as customers have focused investments on 
modernizing infrastructure, such as migrating to cloud-based offerings, including our own. We expect such mixed 
macroeconomic environment to largely continue (though ease slightly) and possibly limit revenue growth in the near 
term.
Supply Chain: During fiscal 2024, we experienced supply chain constraints for certain components, including 
graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and accelerated processing units, but they have since eased, in part due to 
increased availability of supply and lower material and logistics costs. Logistics costs decreased from previously 
elevated levels as a result of declines in both expedited shipments and overall rate costs in the freight network. We 
have, in fact, been experiencing higher-than-normal inventory levels, primarily due to customers transitioning to the 
next generation of GPUs, our securing supply ahead of demand, and longer customer acceptance timelines on AI-
related orders; we expect this trend to continue in the medium term. We have experienced, and expect to continue 
experiencing, rising input component costs and a competitive pricing environment, which may impact our financial 
results. We plan to mitigate the impact of these dynamics through continued disciplined cost and pricing 
management. 
Recurring Revenue and Consumption Models:  We continue to strengthen our core server and storage-
oriented offerings and expand our offerings on the HPE GreenLake cloud, to deliver our entire portfolio as-a-service 
(“aaS”) and become the edge-to-cloud company for our customers and partners. We expect that such flexible 
consumption model will continue to strengthen our customer relationships and contribute to growth in recurring 
revenue. 
Foreign Currency Exposure: We have a large global presence, with more than half of our revenue generated 
outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted 
by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize a comprehensive hedging strategy intended to 
mitigate the impact of foreign currency volatility over time, and we adjust pricing when possible to further minimize 
foreign currency impacts.
Recent Tax Developments: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an 
international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-
standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 
15%. To date, 43 countries have enacted portions, or all, of the OECD proposal and a further 22 countries have 
drafted, or have announced an intent to draft, legislation enacting the proposed rules. Where enacted, the rules 
begin to be effective for us in fiscal 2025. Under US GAAP, the OECD Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative 
minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the 
future minimum tax. As a result, there was no impact to our fiscal 2024 results. The adoption and effective dates of 
these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our 
provision for income taxes. We currently do not expect a material impact to our fiscal 2025 results.
The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is conducting audits of our fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income 
tax returns. During fiscal 2023, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments (“NOPAs”) for 2017, 2018, and 
2019 relating to our intercompany transfer pricing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the IRS issued a Revenue 
Agent Report finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal years. However, we 
disagreed with the IRS’ adjustments and believe the positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to 
prevail on technical merits and have continued with settlement discussions with the IRS. During the third quarter of 
fiscal 2024, we submitted a formal settlement offer to the IRS to facilitate the closing of the audit and recorded 
increased reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $122 million. The impact of the increase in reserves is almost 
entirely offset with a valuation allowance release, and the net impact to income tax expense for fiscal 2024 was not 
material. It is reasonably possible that the IRS audit for fiscal 2017 through 2019 may be concluded in the next 12 
months, and it is reasonably possible that existing unrecognized tax benefits related to these years may be reduced 
by an amount up to $358 million within the next 12 months, the majority of which relates to adjustments to foreign

tax credits that carry a full valuation allowance or to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition, neither 
of which affects the Company’s effective tax rate.
Other Trends and Uncertainties: The impacts of trade protection measures, including increases in tariffs and 
trade barriers, changes in government policies and international trade arrangements, geopolitical volatility (including 
the ongoing conflict in the Middle East), and global macroeconomic challenges (including the relationship between 
China and the U.S.), may impact our operations, financial performance, and ability to conduct business in some 
non-U.S. markets. We monitor and seek to mitigate these risks with adjustments to our manufacturing, supply chain, 
and distribution networks.
Pending Merger with Juniper Networks, Inc: On January 9, 2024, we entered into a definitive Agreement and 
Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) under which we will acquire Juniper Networks in an all-cash transaction 
for $40.00 per share (the “Merger”), representing an equity value of approximately $14 billion. On April 2, 2024, 
Juniper Networks shareholders approved the transaction. The transaction is expected to be funded based on senior 
unsecured delayed draw term loans from a syndicate of banks, the post-tax proceeds from our sale to Unisplendour 
International Technology Limited (“UNIS”) of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C Technologies Co., Limited 
(“H3C”), the net proceeds (including after repayments of maturing debt) of our September 2024 issuances of senior 
unsecured notes and the Preferred Stock (as further described in Note 15, “Stockholders’ Equity” to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II), and cash on the balance sheet. The closing of the 
transaction remains subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.
For further information about the Merger, see Note 10, “Acquisitions and Dispositions” to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, and for further discussion about the risks related to the Merger, see the 
section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The foregoing summary of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and the transactions 
contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text 
of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission on January 10, 2024.
The following Executive Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare 
fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2023, unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and, Cash Requirements and 
Commitments sections present information as of October 31, 2024, unless otherwise noted. 
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Net revenue of $30.1 billion represented an increase of 3.4% (increased 3.3% on a constant currency basis) 
primarily due to higher average unit prices (“AUPs”) in the Server segment, moderated by lower volume and product 
mix effect in the Intelligent Edge segment. The gross profit margin of 32.8% (or $9.9 billion) represents a decrease 
of 2.3 percentage points from the prior-year period due to decline in revenue in the Intelligent Edge segment and 
higher mix of lower margin products in the Server segment. The operating profit margin of 7.3% was relatively flat 
as compared to the prior-year period.

along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of 
non-GAAP financial measures.
Annualized Revenue Run-rate (“ARR”)
Our pivot to aaS continues its strong momentum with the addition of HPE GreenLake cloud services. Our mix 
of ARR is becoming more software-rich as we build our HPE GreenLake cloud, which is improving our margin 
profile. We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake cloud services to provide a true cloud experience 
and operating model, whether at the edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds. 
ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake cloud services revenue, related financial 
services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases),

and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”), software consumption revenue, and other aaS offerings, recognized during a 
quarter and multiplied by four. We believe that ARR is a metric that allows management to better understand and 
highlight the potential future performance of our aaS business. We also believe ARR provides investors with greater 
transparency to our financial information and of the performance metric used in our financial and operational 
decision making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes of management.” We use ARR as a 
performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with 
it.
ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled 
measures presented by other companies. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting 
period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.
The following table presents our ARR:
For the fiscal years ended October 31,
2024 2023
Dollars in millions
ARR $ 1,938 $ 1,304 
Year-over-year growth rate  49 %  39 %
The 49% year over year increase in ARR was primarily due to growth in our Hybrid Cloud, Server and 
Intelligent Edge segments, which was due to an expanding customer installed base, an expanded range of HPE 
GreenLake Flex Solutions, Server aaS, and Intelligent Edge aaS activity.
Capital Returns to Shareholders
Returning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, which also 
consists of strategic investments. We believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, along with 
commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, 
capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing 
operations. As of October 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $15.1 billion, compared to 
$4.6 billion as of October 31, 2023, representing an increase of $10.5 billion. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (“GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. A summary of 
significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated 
Financial Statements are included in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of 
the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly 
uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other 
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under 
different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
We believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of 
operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Revenue Recognition
We enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in 
arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various 
services. 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Page 51:
The majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and 
maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred 
to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be 
offered in contracts with customers, partners, and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts, 
price protection, and other incentive programs. 
Significant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable 
consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we 
estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the 
estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only 
to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' 
right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.
To recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the 
transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) 
basis. For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is generally not directly observable and requires the 
Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin 
objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable 
inputs. For certain products and services, the Company establishes SSP based on the observable price when sold 
separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and 
services and reassesses them periodically.
Taxes on Earnings
We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ 
from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based 
on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the 
year in which we expect the differences to reverse.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not 
to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted 
earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent 
and feasible tax planning strategies. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate 
sufficient taxable income, of the appropriate character, in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are 
located, prior to their expiration under applicable tax laws.
Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for 
which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences 
indefinitely outside the U.S. We will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which 
deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated 
and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations, tax, or cash management reasons.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 80 other countries, and we are subject to 
routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns 
are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on 
examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to 
satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential 
assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts 
ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our 
income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our Provision for taxes, Net earnings and cash 
flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of 
our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany 
transactions and related interest, and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies. For further discussion on 
taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part 
II.

Goodwill
We review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or 
whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are 
permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative 
goodwill impairment test. 
As of October 31, 2024, our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified 
in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, with the exception of 
Server, which contains two reporting units:  Compute and High Performance Computing & AI (“HPC & AI”), and  
Corporate Investments and Other which contains two reporting units: Advisory and Professional Services, and 
legacy Communications and Media Solutions. 
When performing the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying 
amount. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates 
and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived mostly 
from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value 
of a reporting unit is based on discounted cash flow analysis of management's short-term and long-term forecast of 
operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, expected 
operating margins, and timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions and customer 
acceptances. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public 
companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty 
related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair 
value is based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies 
with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the 
market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting 
unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
using the income approach. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets 
and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.
Annual Goodwill Impairment Review
Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2024, did not result in any impairment charges. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units 
ranged from approximately 8% to 198% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% 
decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10% decrease all of the 
reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount, except for HPC & AI and Hybrid Cloud.
The HPC & AI reporting unit has goodwill of $2.0 billion as of October 31, 2024, and excess of fair value over 
carrying value of 11% as of the annual test date. The HPC & AI business is growing at a very fast pace driven 
primarily by the AI demand from model builders, but as GPUs represent a large portion of the solutions, the pricing 
is very competitive and margins are limited. With the growth of AI in enterprise and sovereign customer segments 
and key strategic differentiators, such as direct liquid cooling, we believe that there is a potential for continued 
growth over time.
Interim Goodwill Impairment Reviews
In September 2024, HPE sold 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C to UNIS. The equity investment in 
H3C primarily benefits the Compute and Hybrid Cloud reporting units. Subsequent to the sale, on September 30, 
2024, we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis for Compute and Hybrid Cloud reporting units. The 
excess of fair value over carrying amount for these reporting units was 6% for Compute and 5% for Hybrid Cloud. 
We also applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of Compute and Hybrid Cloud, noting that neither had 
an excess of fair value over carrying amount.
The Compute reporting unit has goodwill of $8.2 billion as of October 31, 2024, and excess of fair value over 
carrying value of 6% as of the September 30, 2024 interim test date. The Compute business is cyclical in nature.

Page 53:
Over the last several years, digital transformation drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, 
in the current macroeconomic and inflationary environment, customers have invested selectively resulting in 
moderate unit growth and competitive pricing. The Compute business continues to focus on capturing market share 
while maintaining operating margin, leveraging its strong portfolio of ProLiant Gen11 products.
The Hybrid Cloud reporting unit has goodwill of $4.8 billion as of October 31, 2024, and excess of fair value 
over carrying value of 5% as of the September 30, 2024 interim test date. Although the Hybrid Cloud business is on 
a positive trajectory, we are managing both a sales model transition and product transition within this business. Our 
product model transition is to a more cloud-native, software-defined platform with HPE Alletra. Translating this 
growth to revenue and operating income will take time because a greater mix of high margin business such as 
ratable software and services, is deferred and recognized in future periods.
Our interim 2024 goodwill impairment test performed as of November 1, 2023 based on organizational 
changes impacting the composition of reporting units as of that date did not result in any impairment charges. 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to 
represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect 
will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for 
assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year 
percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency 
exchange rates from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient 
of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates 
divided by (b) the prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the 
effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our 
revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, 
the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define 
similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

The components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows:
For the fiscal years ended October 31,
2024 2023
Percentage Points
Server  6.4  (3.9) 
Hybrid Cloud  (0.4)  0.9 
Intelligent Edge  (2.9)  5.3 
Financial Services  0.1  0.5

Elimination of intersegment net revenue and other  0.1  (0.5) 
Total HPE  3.4  2.2 
Fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023
From a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in total net revenue are 
summarized as follows:
• Server net revenue increased $1,844 million, or 12.8%, primarily due to higher AUPs
• Hybrid Cloud net revenue decreased $107 million, or 1.9%, primarily due to lower AUPs
• Intelligent Edge net revenue decreased $847 million, or 15.7%, primarily due to lower volume and product 
mix effect
• Financial Services net revenue increased $32 million, or 0.9%, primarily due to higher finance income
• Corporate Investments and Other net revenue increased $29 million, or 2.9%, primarily due to revenue 
growth from Advisory and Professional Services (“A & PS”) 
Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022
From a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in total net revenue are 
summarized as follows:
• Server net revenue decreased $1,111 million, or 7.2%, primarily due to lower server unit volume and 
unfavorable currency fluctuations
• Hybrid Cloud net revenue increased $260 million, or 5.0%, primarily due to higher unit volume
• Intelligent Edge net revenue increased $1,522 million, or 39.5%, primarily due to increased AUPs and 
volume and product mix effect
• Financial Services net revenue increased $141 million, or 4.2%, primarily due to higher rental revenue from 
higher average operating leases and higher finance income on finance leases due to an increasing interest 
rate environment
• Corporate Investments and Other net revenue decreased $27 million, or 2.7%, primarily due to unfavorable 
currency fluctuations
Gross Profit
Fiscal 2024 total gross profit margin of 32.8% represents a decrease of 2.3 percentage points as compared to 
the respective prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to decline in revenue in the Intelligent Edge 
segment and higher mix of lower margin products in the Server segment.
Operating expenses
Research and development (“R&D”)
R&D expense decreased by $103 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to capitalization of software costs, which 
contributed 4.2 percentage points to the change.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
SG&A expense decreased by $289 million, or 5.6%, primarily due to lower employee costs, which contributed 
3.3 percentage points, lower travel and marketing expenses and lower consulting costs, both of which contributed 
1.4 percentage points to the change. 
Transformation programs and costs 
Our transformation programs consist of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan (launched in 2020) and 
the HPE Next Plan (launched in 2017).  
Transformation costs decreased by $190 million, or 67.1%, due to lower charges incurred in the current period 
as the primary elements of these plans have been substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 
3, “Transformation Programs” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II for further discussion.
Acquisition, disposition and other related charges
Acquisition, disposition and other related charges increased by $135 million or 195.7%, primarily due to costs 
incurred in connection with the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks.
Interest and other, net
Interest and other, net expense increased by $13 million or 12.5%, primarily due to lower gain from sale of 
certain investments and unfavorable currency fluctuations in the current year and the previous year containing tax 
indemnification income due to an audit settlement. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in net interest 
expense and lower loss on equity investments in the current year. 
Gain on sale of equity interest
On September 4, 2024, the Company divested 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C to UNIS. We 
continue to possess the option to sell the remaining 19% of the total issued share capital of H3C at a later date. In 
connection with this sale, we recorded a gain on sale of equity interest of $733 million.
Earnings from equity interests
In fiscal 2024, Earnings from equity interests decreased by $98 million or 40%, primarily due to lower net 
income earned by H3C and the disposition of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C, partially offset by lower 
amortization expense from basis difference in the current period.
Provision for taxes 
For fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $374 million and $205 million, respectively, 
which reflect effective tax rates of 12.7% and 9.2%, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the 
U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in 
lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during 
the fiscal year. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate 
in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore. 
In fiscal 2024, we recorded $43 million of net income tax charges related to items discrete to the year. These 
amounts primarily included:
• $104 million of net income tax charges resulting from the gain on the H3C divestiture, which includes $215 
million of U.S. and foreign income tax charges offset by $111 million of income tax benefit for the release of 
an uncertain tax benefit related to the prior divestiture, partially offset by
• $54 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other 
related charges and
• $11 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
In fiscal 2023, we recorded $131 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These 
amounts primarily included:

primarily due to higher mix of lower margin products and competitive pricing pressure. The decrease in operating 
expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to lower total operating expenses as a result of cost 
containment measures.
Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022
Server net revenue decreased by $1,111 million, or 7.2% (decreased 3.5% on a constant currency basis), 
primarily due to a $1,061 million, or 8.9%, decrease in product revenue. The decline in product revenue was 
primarily due to lower server unit volume of $1,281 million, or 10.7%, and unfavorable currency fluctuations of $458 
million, or 3.8%. The product revenue decline was moderated by an increase in AUPs of $683 million, or 5.7%, led 
by higher sales of server configurations with more complex component architectures in our next generation 
products.
Server earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat.

decreased $267 million, or 8.1%, primarily due to a decrease in AUPs of $831 million, or 25.2%, led by private cloud 
and storage products, partially offset by a unit volume increase of $543 million or 16.5%, led by private cloud and 
storage products. Hybrid Cloud services revenue increased by $160 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to a unit volume 
increase of $275 million, or 12.5%, led by private cloud and infrastructure SaaS. This increase was partially offset by 
lower AUPs of $107 million, or 4.9%.
Hybrid Cloud earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat as compared to 
the prior-year period.
Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022
Hybrid Cloud net revenue increased by $260 million, or 5.0% (increased 8.2% on a constant currency basis) 
primarily due to an increase in unit volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations and decrease in 
AUPs. Hybrid Cloud product revenue increased by $180 million, or 5.8%, primarily due to an increase in unit volume 
of $371 million or 11.9%, led by private cloud and infrastructure SaaS. The increase in product revenue was 
moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations of $130 million or 4.2%, and a decrease in AUPs of $39 million or 
1.3%. Hybrid Cloud services revenue increased by $80 million, or 3.8%, primarily due to a unit volume increase of 
$178 million, or 8.4%, led by private cloud and infrastructure SaaS. The increase in service revenue was partially 
offset by decrease in AUPs of $43 million or 2.0% and unfavorable currency fluctuations of $40 million or 1.9%.
Hybrid Cloud earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 4.7 percentage points due 
to an increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a 
percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was 
primarily due to lower margin GreenLake Flex Solutions deals and decrease in storage subscription revenue. The 
increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the unfavorable currency 
fluctuations.

Intelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.4 percentage points 
primarily due to increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by a decrease in 
cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
increased primarily due to scale of net revenue decline, higher employee costs related to acquisitions and

Fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023
FS net revenue increased by $32 million, or 0.9% (increased 0.6% on a constant currency basis) primarily due 
to higher finance income from higher average finance leases in a higher interest rate environment, along with 
favorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower rental revenue on lower average operating leases and lower 
asset management lease buyout revenue.
FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.9 percentage points, although the 
cost of services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 
relatively flat.
Fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022
FS net revenue increased by $141 million, or 4.2% (increased 5.4% on a constant currency basis) due 
primarily to higher rental revenue from higher average operating leases and higher finance income on finance 
leases due to an increasing interest rate environment, partially offset by lower asset management revenue primarily 
from lower pre-owned asset sales and unfavorable currency fluctuations.
FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 3.5% percentage points due primarily 
to an increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue, while operating expenses as a percentage of net 
revenue were relatively flat. The increase to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from 
a combination of higher borrowing costs and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower bad debt 
expense.
Financing Volume
 For the fiscal years ended October 31,

Financing volume $ 6,616 $ 6,412 $ 6,252 
Financing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related 
software and services, including intercompany activity, increased by 3.2% in fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior-
year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher financing of HPE product sales and services, partially 
offset by lower financing of third-party product sales and services.
Portfolio Assets and Ratios
The FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance 
against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal 
management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as 
those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment 
balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) Intercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation.
(2) Allowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions.
(3) Debt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany 
debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled $11.8 
billion and $11.6 billion at October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-
equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at 
October 31, 2024 and 2023, was $1.7 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.
As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, FS net cash and cash equivalents balances were $533 million and $700 
million, respectively.
Net portfolio assets as of October 31, 2024 increased 3.9% from October 31, 2023. The increase generally 
resulted from new financing volume exceeding portfolio runoff during the period, along with favorable currency 
fluctuations. 
FS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves and write-offs for sales-type, 
direct-financing and operating leases. FS recorded net bad debt expense of $57 million, $59 million and $82 million 
in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

increased primarily due to the scale of net revenue decline and increases in cost of services due to unfavorable 
currency fluctuations and higher expenses. 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Current Overview 
We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated 
cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product 
development initiatives, acquisitions and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, 
transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to 
any future investments, share repurchases, and shareholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this 
short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under 
credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital 
markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic 
conditions. We anticipate that the funds made available, including the debt funding related to the pending merger 
with Juniper Networks, proceeds from issuance of the Preferred Stock and proceeds from the sale of 30% of the 
total issued share capital of H3C, and cash generated from our operations, along with our access to capital markets, 
will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months (including for the payment of 
consideration to consummate the Juniper Networks transaction) and for the foreseeable future thereafter.  Our 
liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and 
market risks identified in the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in 
Item 7A.
Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held in the 
U.S. as of October 31, 2024. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our 
worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed.
Amounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support our non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations 
of amounts held outside the U.S. generally will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be 
subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer 
of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash 
flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of 
amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition, or results of 
operations.
In connection with the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, during fiscal 
2024, we repurchased and settled an aggregate amount of $150 million. As of October 31, 2024 , we had a 
remaining authorization of approximately $0.8 billion for future share repurchases. For more information on our 
share repurchase program, refer to Note 15, “Stockholders' Equity,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Item 8 of Part II.

On May 23, 2024, we announced plans to divest our Communications Technology Group (“CTG”) business to 
HCLTech. CTG is included in our Communications and Media Solutions business, which is reported in the 
Corporate Investments and Other segment. This divestiture includes the platform-based software solutions portions 
of the CTG portfolio, including systems integration, network applications, data intelligence, and the business support 
systems groups. As of October 31, 2024, assets and liabilities to be sold have been presented in our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale. On December 1, 2024, we completed the disposition of CTG. 
We received net proceeds of $210 million and expect to recognize a gain of approximately $230 million.
On January 9, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement, under which HPE will acquire Juniper Networks in 
an all-cash transaction for $40.00 per share, representing an equity value of approximately $14 billion . The 
transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. On April 2, 2024, Juniper 
Networks shareholders approved the transaction. The closing of the transaction remains subject to receipt of 
regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. In connection with the merger, we 
entered into a commitment letter whereby we obtained a commitment from Citigroup Global Markets Inc., JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for a $14.0 billion senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, 
comprised of an $11.0 billion 364-day tranche and a $3.0 billion three-year tranche, subject to customary conditions 
(the “Term Loan Commitment Letter”). In September 2024, we issued $9.0 billion of senior unsecured notes and 
$1.5 billion of Preferred Stock, the net proceeds of which we intend to use to fund a portion of the consideration for 
the acquisition of Juniper Networks and for other general corporate purposes, which may include, among other 
uses, repaying certain indebtedness of HPE, Juniper Networks and our and its respective subsidiaries. In addition, 
in furtherance of the Term Loan Commitment Letter, we entered into term loan agreements with JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A, Citibank, N.A., and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for approximately $12.0 billion of senior unsecured delayed draw 
term loan facilities, comprised of an approximately $9.0 billion 364-day tranche (which was reduced from the original 
commitment of $11.0 billion, upon receipt and application of approximately $2.0 billion in post-tax proceeds from our 
sale to UNIS of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C, as further described below) and a $3.0 billion three-
year tranche, subject to customary conditions. We have since further reduced the commitments under the 364-day 
term loan to $1.0 billion upon receipt and application of certain proceeds from the aforementioned issuance of 
senior unsecured notes and the Preferred Stock. Unless previously terminated, commitments under both the 364-
day term loan and the three-year term loan will terminate upon the earliest of (i) five business days after the Juniper 
Outside Date (as defined in such term loan agreements), (ii) the occurrence of the closing of the acquisition of 
Juniper Networks without the funding of any borrowings under either of the term loan agreements, and (iii) the 
termination of the Merger Agreement by HPE in writing in accordance with its terms. In connection with the entry 
into the aforementioned 364-day term loan and the three-year term loan, on September 12, 2024, we terminated the 
Term Loan Commitment Letter.
In September 2024, we issued 30 million shares of the Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, for an 
aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, less issuance costs of $38 million. As of October 31, 2024, 30 million 
shares of the Preferred Stock was outstanding. We intend to use these net proceeds as indicated above. For more 
information on our Preferred Stock, refer to Note 15, “Stockholders' Equity,” to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among our relevant subsidiaries, UNIS, and H3C dated as of May 1, 
2016, as amended from time to time, and most recently on October 28, 2022, we delivered a notice to UNIS on 
December 30, 2022, to exercise our right to put to UNIS, for cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by us, 
which represent 49% of the total issued share capital of H3C. On May 26, 2023, our relevant subsidiaries entered 
into a Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby UNIS has agreed to purchase all of the H3C shares held 
by us, through our subsidiaries. On May 24, 2024, our relevant subsidiaries entered into (i) an Amended and 
Restated Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby our relevant subsidiaries shall sell to UNIS 30% of 
the total issued share capital of H3C for pre-tax cash consideration of approximately $2.1 billion by August 31, 2024 
(the “Sale Transaction”), and (ii) an Agreement on Subsequent Arrangements with UNIS, whereby upon closing of 
the Sale Transaction, our relevant subsidiary shall have a put option to sell to UNIS and UNIS shall have a call

Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 10,524 $ (182) $ 431 
Free cash flow $ 2,297 $ 2,238 $ 1,794 
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $87 million for fiscal 2024, as compared to fiscal 2023. 
The decrease was primarily due to higher cash payouts for variable compensation, unfavorable impacts from 
financing receivables, and lower cash generated from operations. The decrease was moderated by favorable 
working capital, as compared to the prior-year period.
Our working capital metrics and cash conversion impacts were as follows:
 As of October 31,
 2024 2023 2022
Days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable (“DSO”)  38  43  47 
Days of supply in inventory (“DOS”)  120  87  88 
Days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable (“DPO”)  (170)  (134)  (149) 
Cash conversion cycle  (12)  (4)  (14) 
The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash 
conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in 
payment terms (including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers), early or late invoice payments

from customers or to suppliers, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of the revenue 
recognition and inventory purchases within the period, the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity. 
DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing 
ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. Compared 
to the corresponding three-month period in fiscal 2023, the decrease in DSO by 5 days in the current period was 
primarily due to higher early collections.
DOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products. DOS is calculated by 
dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month 
period in fiscal 2023, the increase in DOS by 33 days in the current period was primarily due to higher inventory 
levels caused by strategic purchases of key components to support growth in AI systems.
DPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is 
calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the 
corresponding three-month period in fiscal 2023, the increase in DPO by 36 days in the current period was primarily 
due to higher inventory purchases.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $3.2 billion  in fiscal 2024, as compared to the 
corresponding period in fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily due to proceeds from UNIS in connection with the 
sale of 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C of $2.1 billion, lower net payments made in connection with 
business acquisitions of $0.6 billion, lower cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of $0.2 billion, and lower 
investments in property, plant and equipment and software assets, net of sales proceeds of $0.2 billion, as 
compared to the prior-year period.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $7.6 billion  in fiscal 2024, as compared to the 
corresponding period in fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to higher proceeds from debt issuance (net of issuance 
costs) of $6.5 billion, proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Stock (net of issuance costs) of $1.5 billion, and 
lower share repurchases of $0.3 billion, partially offset by higher repayments of debt of $0.6 billion, as compared to 
the prior-year period.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow (“FCF”) represents cash flow from operations less net capital expenditures (investments in 
property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) and software assets less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF increased by 
$0.1 billion, as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to lower net capital 
expenditures, as compared to the prior-year period. For more information on our FCF, refer to the section entitled 
“GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations” included in this MD&A.
For more information on the impact of operating assets and liabilities to our cash flows, see Note 7, “Balance 
Sheet Details,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of several factors, including cash flow 
expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase 
activities, our cost of capital, and targeted capital structure. We maintain a revolving credit facility and two 
commercial paper programs, “the Parent Programs”, and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. In 
September 2024, we terminated the prior senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was entered into in 
December 2021, and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate lending 
commitment of $5.25 billion for a period of five years . The commitment is comprised of (i) $4.75 billion of 
commitments available immediately and (ii) $500 million of commitments available from and subject to the closing of 
the Juniper Networks acquisition and refinancing of Juniper Networks’ credit agreement in connection with the 
closing of the Juniper Networks acquisition. There have been no changes to our commercial paper programs since 
October 31, 2023.
As noted above, we are also party to two senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facilities, comprised of a 
$1.0 billion 364-day tranche and a $3.0 billion three-year tranche, subject to customary conditions. Unless 
previously terminated, commitments under both the 364-day term loan and the three-year term loan will terminate 
upon the earliest of (i) five business days after the Juniper Outside Date (as defined in such term loan agreements), 
(ii) the occurrence of the closing of the acquisition of Juniper Networks without the funding of any borrowings under 
either of the term loan agreements, and (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement by HPE in writing in 
accordance with its terms.
In December 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
allows us to sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, preferred stock, 
common stock, warrants, depository shares, purchase contracts, guarantees or units consisting of any of these 
securities.
Significant funding and liquidity activities for fiscal 2024 were as follows:
Debt Issuances:
• In September 2024, we issued (i) $1.25 billion of 4.45% Senior Notes due September 25, 2026, (ii) $1.25 
billion of 4.40% Senior Notes due September 25, 2027, (iii) $1.75 billion of 4.55% Senior Notes due October 
15, 2029, (iv) $1.25 billion of 4.85% Senior Notes due October 15, 2031, (v) $2.0 billion of 5.00% Senior 
Notes due October 15, 2034, and (vi) $1.5 billion of 5.60% Senior Notes due October 15, 2054.
• In June 2024, we issued $818 million of asset-backed debt securities in six tranches with a weighted 
average interest rate of 5.593% and final maturity date of April 2032.
• In January 2024, we issued $796 million of asset-backed debt securities in six tranches with a weighted 
average interest rate of 5.476% and final maturity date of November 2031.
Debt Repayments:
• In October 2024, we redeemed $400 million of 6.102% Senior Notes with an original maturity date of April 1, 
2026, utilizing the par call option on the debt, with no redemption penalties.
• In October 2024, we repaid $1.6 billion of 5.90% Senior Notes on their original maturity date.
• In April 2024, we repaid $1.0 billion of 1.45% Senior Notes on their original maturity date.
• During fiscal 2024, we repaid $1,691 million of the outstanding asset-backed debt securities. 
Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the 
period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13, 
“Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
For more information on our available borrowing resources and the impact of operating assets and liabilities to 
cash flows, see Note 14, “Borrowings,” and Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” respectively, to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
Cash Requirements and Commitments 
Long-term debt and interest payments on debt
As of October 31, 2024 , future principal payment obligations on our long-term debt including asset-backed

Page 67:
debt securities totaled $17.6 billion of which $4.0 billion is due within one year. As of October 31, 2024, our finance 
lease obligations, including interest, was $42 million, of which $7 million is to be due within one year. For more 
information on our debt, see Note 14, “Borrowings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
As of October 31, 2024 , future interest payments relating to our long-term debt is estimated to be 
approximately $7.6 billion, of which $0.9 billion is expected to be due within one year. We use interest rate swaps to 
mitigate the exposure of our fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or 
hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate debt. The impact of our 
outstanding interest rate swaps as of October 31, 2024  was factored into the calculation of the future interest 
payments on long-term debt.
Operating lease obligations 
We enter into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, vehicles, and 
aviation. As of October 31, 2024, operating lease obligations, net of sublease rental income totaled $1.7 billion, of 
which $286 million is due within one year. For more information on our leases, see Note 8, “Accounting for Leases 
as a Lessee,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
Unconditional purchase obligations 
Our unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, software maintenance 
and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable 
without penalty. As of October 31, 2024 , unconditional purchase obligations totaled $1.3 billion , of which 
$556 million is due within one year. For more information on our unconditional purchase obligations, see Note 17, 
“Litigation, Contingencies, and Commitments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. 
Retirement Benefit Plan Funding
In fiscal 2024, we anticipate making contributions of $189 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is 
to fund pension plans to meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities 
including local government and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-
retirement benefit plans are not considered as contractual obligations because they do not represent contractual 
cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more 
information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement 
Benefit Plans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
Restructuring Plans
As of October 31, 2024, we expect future cash payments of approximately $185 million in connection with our 
approved restructuring plans, which includes $80 million expected to be paid in fiscal 2025 and $105 million 
expected to be paid thereafter. Payments for restructuring activities are not considered as contractual obligations, 
because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these 
payments. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3, “Transformation Programs,” to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of October 31, 2024 , we had approximately $186 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and 
penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions that could result in a cash payment. These liabilities and related 
interest and penalties include $2 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are 
unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the 
uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing 
authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings,” to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships 
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or

special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other 
contractually narrow or limited purposes.
We have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital 
requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing 
arrangements, see Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

Use of non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the 
business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from 
operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net 
revenue), non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and FCF. These 
non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a 
constant currency basis is net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is 
gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. 
The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP earnings from operations is earnings from operations.

Page 70:
The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from 
operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of 
net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The 
GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most 
directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP 
measure most directly comparable to FCF is cash flow from operations.
We believe that providing the non-GAAP measures stated above, in addition to the related GAAP measures 
provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows 
the reader of our Consolidated Financial Statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of management. 
We further believe that providing this information provides investors with a supplemental view to understand our 
historical and prospective operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information 
used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial 
measures also facilitates comparisons of our operating performance with the performance of other companies in the 
same industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a 
similar manner.
Economic Substance of non-GAAP Financial Measures
Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the 
comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating our past and future performance, 
without the impact of foreign exchange rates, as more than half of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S. We 
believe that excluding the items mentioned below from the non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental 
view to management and our investors of our consolidated financial performance and presents the financial results 
of the business without costs that we do not believe to be reflective of our ongoing operating results. Exclusion of 
these items can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus limiting the use of 
such non-GAAP financial measures as analytic tools. See “Compensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP 
Financial Measures” section below for further information.
Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges related to the 
amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense, and disaster charges. See below for the 
reasons management excludes each item:
• Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of 
those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our 
employees, we exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily 
because they are non-cash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry 
participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation 
expense.
• Disaster recoveries include direct costs or recovery of these costs related to the exit of the Company’s 
businesses in Russia and Belarus. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes disaster recoveries from these 
non-GAAP measures as the specific net recoveries are non-recurring charges and not indicative of the 
operational performance of our business.
• Divestiture related exit costs include expenses associated with certain disposal activities. On May 23, 2024, 
HPE announced plans to divest the Company’s CTG business, which was completed on December 1, 2024. 
We consider this divestiture to be a discrete event. We exclude these costs as these expenses are non-
recurring exit costs to eliminate stranded costs of this business. In addition, our internal benchmarking 
analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures 
excluding these charges.
Non-GAAP earnings from operations and non-GAAP operating profit margin consist of earnings from 
operations or earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue excluding the items mentioned above and 
charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other 
related charges. In addition to the items previously explained above, management excludes these items for the 
following reasons:
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
68


Page 71:
• We incur charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and exclude these charges for purposes 
of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and 
magnitude of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP 
measures, primarily because they are noncash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence 
that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset 
amortization. Although this does not directly affect our cash position, the loss in value of intangible assets 
over time can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure. 
• Transformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and 
Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to 
transform our IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment charges on real 
estate identified as part of the initiatives. We exclude these costs as they are discrete costs related to two 
specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017 and 2020, respectively, as multi-year 
programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure following material divestiture 
transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product portfolio in fiscal 2020. The 
primary elements of the HPE Next and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan have been substantially 
completed by October 31, 2023. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from our non-GAAP 
financial measures as stated above is to provide a supplemental measure of our operating results that does 
not include material HPE Next Plan and Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as we do not 
believe such costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating cost structure. Further as our transformation 
costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have been materially declining since 2021 and 
we do not expect to incur material transformation costs related to these programs beyond fiscal 2024, we 
believe non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to management and investors for comparing 
operating performance across multiple periods.
• We incur costs related to our acquisition, disposition and other related charges. The charges are direct 
expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-
capitalized expenses. For fiscal 2024, these charges were driven by costs associated with the pending 
merger with Juniper Networks and the acquisition of Morpheus Data, in addition to prior acquisitions of Axis, 
Athonet and OpsRamp. For fiscal 2023, these charges were driven by acquisitions of Axis, Zerto, OpsRamp 
and Athonet. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and 
arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. We consider these acquisitions and 
divestitures to be discrete events. We exclude these costs as these expenses are inconsistent in amount 
and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of our acquisitions and divestitures. 
In addition, our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present 
non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges.
Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net 
earnings per share excluding those same charges mentioned above, as well as other items such as adjustments for 
equity interests, gain or loss on equity investments, other adjustments, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments 
for taxes line item includes certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, 
structural rate adjustment, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes 
or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. In addition to the items previously explained, management 
excludes these items for the following reasons:
• During the six months ended April 30, 2024, we stopped reporting H3C earnings in our non-GAAP results 
due to the planned divestiture of the H3C investment. Per the terms of the original Put Share Purchase 
Agreement, we weren’t anticipating receiving dividends from this investment prospectively. However, on 
May 24, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Put Share Purchase Agreement and an 
Agreement on Subsequent Arrangements, both with UNIS, as described in Note 19 “Equity Interests” to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which, taken together, revise the arrangements 
governing the aforementioned sale as previously set forth in the original Put Share Purchase Agreement. 
On September 4, 2024, we divested 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C, which resulted in a gain 
of $733 million and is included in the fiscal 2024 adjustment Gain on sale of equity interest. We continue to 
possess the option to sell the remaining 19% of the total issued share capital of H3C at a later date. For the 
second half of fiscal 2024, the adjustment for equity interests incorporated the completed divestment of 
30% of the total issued share capital of H3C. All periods presented include the amortization of the basis 
difference in our investment. For fiscal 2023, this adjustment also included our portion of intangible asset

impairment charges from H3C. We believe that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-
GAAP financial measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance.
• We exclude gains and losses (including impairments) on our non-marketable equity investments because 
we do not believe they are reflective of normal continuing business operations. These adjustments are 
reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We believe eliminating these 
adjustments for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current 
operating performance.
• We utilize a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide consistency across 
the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to our operating 
structure that can vary in size, frequency and timing. When projecting this long-term rate, we evaluated a 
three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year 
projection period and considers other factors including our expected tax structure, our tax positions in 
various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where we 
operate. For fiscal 2024, we used a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 15%, which reflects currently 
available information as well as other factors and assumptions. For fiscal 2023 we used a non-GAAP 
income tax rate of 14%. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, 
including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix 
including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-
evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. We believe that making these adjustments for purposes of 
calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a supplemental evaluation of our current operating performance 
and comparisons to past operating results.
FCF is defined as cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in PP&E and software 
assets less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, 
cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period. 
Our management and investors can use FCF for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for 
investment in our businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating our historical and 
prospective liquidity.
Compensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be 
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations 
in relying on these non- GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP 
earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other companies (limiting the usefulness 
of those measures for comparative purposes) and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of 
certain assets.
We compensate for these limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our 
GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. We also provide a reconciliation of 
each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this fiscal year and 
prior periods, and we encourage investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks 
that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to 
these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to 
manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. 
Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for 
each of these exposures is outlined below.
Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in 
the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures 
and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related 
exposure.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, 
anticipated purchases, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact 
business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our 
operations for fiscal 2024 were the euro, Japanese yen, and Indian rupee. For most currencies, we are a net 
receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a 
stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a 
weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.
We use a combination of forward contracts and, from time to time, options designated as cash flow hedges to 
protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser 
extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. 
dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign 
currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, 
consisting primarily of forward contracts, to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may 
choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a 
natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too 
expensive to hedge.
We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, using a modeling technique that 
measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign 
currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of 
our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we 
used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency 
exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $44 million and $48 million at October 31, 2024 
and 2023, respectively.
Interest rate risk
We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued, our debt investment portfolio and net 
portfolio assets of our Financial Services segment. We issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign 
currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing.
We often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the 
debt to achieve U.S. dollar based floating or fixed interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the 
exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, in circumstances where we believe additional fixed-rate 
debt would be beneficial, we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap, or swap certain floating interest 
payments to fixed.
We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, using a modeling technique that 
measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of interest 
rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, debt 
investments, net portfolio assets, and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the 
debt, debt investments, net portfolio assets, and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the 
market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a 
71


Page 74:
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt, debt 
investments and net portfolio assets, net of interest rate swaps, of $233 million and $41 million at October 31, 2024 
and 2023, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and 
subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, 
comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 
31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, 
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at 
October 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended October 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 19, 2024 expressed an unqualified 
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial 
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to 
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, 
subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit 
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which 
they relate.
Valuation of goodwill
Description of the 
matter
At October 31, 2024, the Company’s goodwill was $18 billion, of which $4.8 billion 
related to the Hybrid Cloud reporting unit. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated 
financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting 
unit level and more frequently when warranted based on indicators of impairment. 
Auditing management’s goodwill impairment test for the Hybrid Cloud reporting unit 
was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to 
determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimates of the 
Hybrid Cloud reporting unit was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as the 
terminal revenue growth rate and operating margin, which are affected by expectations 
about future market or economic conditions.
74


Page 77:
How we addressed 
the matter in our 
audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process, 
including controls over the significant assumptions described above. 
To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s Hybrid Cloud reporting unit, we 
performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and 
testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by 
the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by 
management to current industry and economic trends and evaluated whether changes 
to the Company’s business model, product mix and other factors would affect the 
significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s 
estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the 
changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the 
assumptions.
In addition, we tested management’s reconciliation of the fair value of all the reporting 
units to the market capitalization of the Company. We involved our valuation 
professionals to evaluate the application of valuation methodologies in the Company’s 
annual impairment test.
Estimation of variable consideration
Description of the 
matter
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company 
recognizes revenue for sales to its customers after deducting management’s estimates 
of variable consideration which may include various rebates, volume-based discounts, 
price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, partners, 
and distributors. Estimated variable consideration is presented within other accrued 
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and totaled $1.0 billion at October 31, 
2024. Auditing the estimates of variable consideration associated with rebates, 
specifically within the Intelligent Edge segment, was complex and judgmental due to 
the level of uncertainty involved in management’s estimate of expected usage of these 
programs.
How we addressed 
the matter in our 
audit 
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process for estimating rebates, including 
controls over the significant assumptions described above.
To test the Company’s determination of variable consideration we performed audit 
procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodologies, testing the 
significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of 
the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant 
assumptions to historical experience of the Company to develop an expectation of the 
rebates associated with product remaining in the distribution channel at October 31, 
2024, which we compared to management’s recorded amount. In addition, we 
inspected the underlying agreements and compared the incentive rates used in the 
Company’s analyses with contractual rates. We assessed the historical accuracy of 
management’s estimates by comparing previous estimates of rebate liabilities to the 
amount of actual payments in subsequent periods.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial 
reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In 
our opinion, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material 
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, the 
related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each 
of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated December 19, 
2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting 
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm 
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Background
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” or the “Company”) is a global 
technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon 
data seamlessly from edge to cloud. Hewlett Packard Enterprise enables customers to accelerate business 
outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing 
operational efficiency today and into the future. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's customers range from small- and 
medium-sized businesses to large global enterprises and governmental entities.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles (“GAAP”). 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its 
subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All 
intercompany transactions and accounts within the consolidated businesses of the Company have been eliminated.
The Company consolidates a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) where it has been determined that the Company 
is the primary beneficiary of the entity's operation. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb 
losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether 
the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its power to direct the most significant activities of 
the VIE by considering the purpose and design of the entity and the risks the entity was designed to create and 
pass through to its variable interest holders. The Company also evaluates its economic interests in the VIE.
The Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant 
influence but does not hold a controlling interest under the equity method of accounting, and the Company records 
its proportionate share of income or losses in Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of 
Earnings. 
Non-controlling interests are presented as a separate component within Total stockholders' equity in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests are recorded within Interest and 
other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately, as they were not material 
for any periods presented.
Segment Realignment 
Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2024, in order to align the segment financial reporting more closely with 
its business structure, the Company established two new reportable segments, Hybrid Cloud and Server. Hybrid 
Cloud includes the historical Storage segment, HPE GreenLake Flex Solutions (which provides flexible as-a-service 
(“aaS”) IT infrastructure through the HPE GreenLake cloud and was previously reported under the Compute and the 
High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence (“HPC & AI”) segments), Private Cloud, and Software 
(previously reported under the Corporate Investments and Other segment). The Server segment combines the 
previously separately reported Compute and HPC & AI segments, with adjustments for certain product lines that are 
now reported in Hybrid Cloud. Additionally, certain products and services previously reported in the financial results 
for the HPC & AI segment were moved to be reported in the Hybrid Cloud segment, and the Athonet business and 
certain components of the Communications and Media Solutions (“CMS”) business, both previously reported in the 
financial results for Corporate Investments and Other, moved to be reported in the Intelligent Edge segment. 
As a result, the Company’s organizational structure for fiscal 2024 consisted of the following segments: (i) 
Server; (ii) Hybrid Cloud; (iii) Intelligent Edge; (iv) Financial Services; and (v) Corporate Investments and Other. The 
Company began reporting under this re-aligned segment structure beginning with the results of the first quarter of 
fiscal 2024 included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024. These 
changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, net 
earnings, net earnings per share (“EPS”) or total assets.

Russia/Ukraine Conflict
In response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the U.S., 
European Union and other countries, the Company determined that it was no longer tenable to maintain its 
operations in Russia and Belarus and has been proceeding with an orderly, managed exit of its remaining business 
in these countries. During fiscal 2022, the Company recorded total pre-tax charges of $161 million primarily related 
to expected credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets, 
$99 million of which was included in Financing cost, $12 million in Cost of services and $50 million in Disaster 
charges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions 
that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are 
assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, including those related to revenue recognition, 
stock-based compensation, net periodic benefit costs, restructuring accruals, provision for taxes, valuation 
allowance for deferred taxes, provision for expected credit losses, inventory reserves, and impairment assessments 
of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The Company believes that these estimates, judgments 
and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of 
which are beyond the Company's control. Should any of these estimates change, it could adversely affect the 
Company's results of operations. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different 
assumptions or conditions.  
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated 
in non-U.S. currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities 
and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses 
denominated in non-U.S. currencies are recorded in U.S. dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during 
the period. The Company includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net in 
the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and gains and losses from cash flow hedges in Net revenue as the 
hedged revenue is recognized. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional 
currency, and the Company records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance 
sheet date as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Revenue Recognition
The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when both parties have provided written approval and 
are committed to perform, each party's rights including payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial 
substance, and collection of consideration is probable. 
The Company enters into contracts with customers that typically include combinations of products and 
services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products 
and/or various services. The Company determines whether each product or service is distinct in order to identify the 
performance obligations in the contract and allocate the contract transaction price among the distinct performance 
obligations. Arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its 
own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether the commitment to transfer the product 
or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. The Company classifies 
its hardware, perpetual software licenses, service arrangements and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) as distinct 
performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and 
software maintenance. In transactions where the Company delivers hardware or software, it is typically the principal 
and records revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.
The majority of the Company's revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated 
support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is 
transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be 
entitled, in exchange for those products or services. Variable consideration offered in contracts with customers, 
partners and distributors may include rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive

Page 88:
programs. Variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period 
as additional information becomes available and recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant 
reversal of revenue will not occur.
Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon 
delivery once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for 
maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. The Company's hardware 
and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon 
transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are 
recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably 
over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements have one distinct 
performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the 
customer consumes the services. On its product sales, the Company records consideration from shipping and 
handling on a gross basis within net product sales. Revenue is recorded net of any associated sales taxes.
The Company allocates the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative 
standalone selling price basis (“SSP”). For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is generally not directly 
observable and requires the Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available 
data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, 
as well as other observable inputs. For certain products and services, the Company establishes SSP based on the 
observable price when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. The Company establishes 
SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically.
Judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as the Company may be required to estimate variable 
consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration may include various 
rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, 
partners and distributors. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, the Company estimates the 
expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and updates the estimate at 
each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. The Company also considers the customers' right of 
return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.
Contract Balances
Accounts receivable and contract assets
A receivable is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services the Company has transferred to a 
customer that is unconditional. A contract asset is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services 
transferred to a customer that is conditional on something other than the passage of time. A receivable is recorded 
when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.  
The Company's contract assets include unbilled receivables which are recorded when the Company 
recognizes revenue in advance of billings. Unbilled receivables generally relate to services contracts where a 
service has been performed and control has transferred, but invoicing to the customer is subject to future milestone 
billings or other contractual payment schedules. The Company classifies unbilled receivables as Accounts 
receivable.
Contract liabilities
A contract liability is an obligation to transfer products or services to a customer for which the Company has 
received consideration, or the amount is due, from the customer. The Company's contract liabilities primarily consist 
of deferred revenue and customer deposits. Deferred revenue is recorded when amounts invoiced to customers are 
in excess of revenue that can be recognized because performance obligations have not been satisfied and control 
of the promised products or services has not transferred to the customer. Deferred revenue largely represents 
amounts invoiced in advance for product (hardware/software) support contracts, consulting projects and product 
sales where revenue cannot be recognized yet. Customer deposits largely represent payments received from 
customers in advance of the Company’s completion of its contractual obligations. As customer acceptance 
milestones are met, the Company will recognize revenue and reduce the amount of contract liabilities.

Costs to obtain a contract with a customer
The Company capitalizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, primarily sales 
commissions, if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, 
to expense the costs of obtaining a contract as incurred for contracts with terms of one year or less. The typical 
amortization periods used range from two to five years. The Company periodically reviews the capitalized sales 
commission costs for possible impairment losses. The amortization of capitalized costs to obtain a contract are 
included in Selling, general and administrative expense. Refer to Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details” for additional 
information. 
Shipping and Handling
The Company includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of products.
Stock-Based Compensation 
Stock-based compensation expense is based on the measurement date fair value of the award and is 
recognized only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. Stock-based 
compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units with only a service condition is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For stock options and restricted stock units with 
both a service condition and a performance or market condition, the expense is recognized on a graded vesting 
basis over the requisite service period of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is determined at the 
aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with 
performance and/or market conditions. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience.
Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans
The Company has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory, retirement and post-
retirement plans. The costs and obligations for these plans depend on various assumptions. Major assumptions 
relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-
term return on plan assets. These assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in 
Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.”
The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities 
with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan 
participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. The expected increase in the 
compensation levels assumption reflects long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-
term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset 
correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. In any fiscal year, significant differences may 
arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between 
the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset 
allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences 
between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the 
use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. 
The following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions of discount rates, the 
expected increase in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on the 
net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2024:

The Company generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the 
average remaining estimated service life or, in the case of closed plans, life expectancy of participants. In limited 
cases, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor approach. 
Advertising
Costs to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising 
are expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising expense totaled approximately $117 million, $173 million, 
and $179 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Restructuring
The Company's transformation programs include charges to approved restructuring plans. Restructuring 
charges include severance costs to eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate 
facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. These restructuring actions require 
management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce 
reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the 
value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs. The Company records restructuring charges based on 
estimated employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. The Company accrues for severance 
and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the 
amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, 
historical experiences and negotiated settlements. For a full description of the Company's restructuring actions, 
refer to the discussions in Note 3, “Transformation Programs.”
Taxes on Earnings
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in 
effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely 
than not to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future market 
growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the 
Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company were to determine 
that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the 
future, the Company would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings in 
the period in which such a determination was made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that the deferred tax 
assets are more likely than not to be realized, the Company would reverse the applicable portion of the previously 
recognized valuation allowance. In order for the Company to realize deferred tax assets, the Company must be able 
to generate sufficient taxable income, of the appropriate character, in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax 
assets are located, prior to their expiration under applicable tax laws.
The Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes that it is not more 
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical 
merits of the position. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions 
as well as any related interest and penalties. The Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements 
and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings.
The Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax in the U.S. The Company 
elected to treat taxes on future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts Receivable
The allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable is comprised of a general reserve and 
a specific reserve. The Company may record a specific reserve for individual accounts when the Company 
becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the 
customer's operating results or financial position. If there are additional changes in circumstances related to the

specific customer, the Company further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. The Company 
maintains an allowance for credit losses for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the financial 
condition of customers and the length of time receivables are past due. These qualitative factors are subjective and 
require a degree of management judgment. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the 
contractual payment terms of the receivable. The Company establishes an allowance for expected credit losses 
related to accounts receivable, including unbilled receivables.
Financing Receivable
The allowance for expected credit losses related to financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve 
and a specific reserve. The Company establishes a specific reserve for financing receivables with identified 
exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely the Company will recover its 
investment. For individually evaluated receivables, the Company determines the expected cash flow for the 
receivable, which includes consideration of estimated proceeds from disposition of the collateral and calculates an 
estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts where a loss is considered probable, 
the Company records a specific reserve. The Company maintains a general reserve using a credit loss model on a 
regional basis and bases such percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and 
portfolio delinquencies, trends in the overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic 
conditions, and forward-looking information, including reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company 
excludes accounts evaluated as part of the specific reserve from the general reserve analysis. The Company 
generally writes off a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due, or 
sooner if the Company determines that the receivable is not collectible.
Non-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables
The Company considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not received by 
the contractually specified due date. The Company generally places financing receivables on non-accrual status, 
which is the suspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be non-performing at the earlier of 
the time at which full payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the receivable becomes 90 days past 
due. Subsequently, the Company may recognize revenue on non-accrual financing receivables as payments are 
received, which is on a cash basis, if the Company deems the recorded financing receivable to be fully collectible; 
however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of the recorded financing receivable, all cash receipts 
are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable, which is the cost recovery method. In certain 
circumstances, such as when the Company deems a delinquency to be of an administrative nature, financing 
receivables may accrue interest after becoming 90 days past due. The non-accrual status of a financing receivable 
may not impact a customer's risk rating. After all of a customer's delinquent principal and interest balances are 
settled, the Company may return the related financing receivable to accrual status.
Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist 
principally of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, receivables from trade customers and 
contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.
The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, derivatives, and certain 
other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in many different 
geographic regions, and the Company's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of 
its risk management processes, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these 
financial institutions. The Company has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial 
institutions. The Company utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency and interest 
rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a 
material loss. For more details on the collateral program, see Note 13, “Financial Instruments.”
Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from trade customers and financing receivables is generally 
diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across 
many different industries and geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial 
condition of its customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain 
circumstances. As of October 31, 2024  and 2023 no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the 
Company's receivable from trade customers and financing receivables.

Page 92:
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash is included within Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets 
and is primarily related to cash received under the Company's collateral securities agreements for its derivative 
instruments and cash restricted under the fixed-term securitization program for the issuance of asset-backed debt 
securities.
Inventory
The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard 
cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. At each reporting period, the Company assesses 
the value of its inventory and writes down the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required, for estimated 
excess or obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in future demand forecasts, market 
conditions, technological changes, product life-cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product 
pricing, physical deterioration, and quality issues. If in any period the Company anticipates a change in those factors 
to be less favorable than its previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and could 
materially impact gross margin. The write down for excess or obsolescence is charged to the provision of inventory, 
which is a component of Cost of Products and Cost of Services in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At the 
point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in 
facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
Property, Plant and Equipment, net
The Company states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company 
capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense 
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are five to 
40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. The Company 
depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. The Company 
depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. 
The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer services contract generally do not exceed 
the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation 
are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings.
The Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use 
software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and installation and testing of the 
software. The Company amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives of the software, generally from three to five years.
Leases
Lessee Accounting
The Company enters into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, 
vehicles, and aviation. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement contains 
a lease when the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset over the lease term. Upon 
lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and right-of-
use (“ROU”) asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The lease liability is measured at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments not yet paid 
over the lease term and the Company's incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company's leases do not 
provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which the 
Company would borrow, on a secured basis, in the country where the lease was executed. The ROU asset is based 
on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, and the lessee's initial direct costs. 
Fixed payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets and liabilities, while non-lease components, such as 
maintenance or utility charges are expensed as incurred. The Company has agreements with lease and non-lease 
components that are accounted for separately and not included in its leased assets and corresponding liabilities for 
the majority of the Company's lease agreements. The Company allocates consideration to the lease and non-lease 
components using their relative standalone values. The lease term may include options to extend or to terminate the

Page 93:
lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company has elected not to record leases with an 
initial term of twelve months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For finance leases, the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the 
asset or the lease term. Interest expense on the lease liability is recorded separately using the interest method. For 
operating leases, lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Lessor Accounting
The Company's lease offerings are non-cancelable and the payment schedule primarily consists of fixed 
payments. Variable payments that are based on an index are included in lease receivables. The Company allocates 
consideration amongst lease components and non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis, 
when lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations. At the end of the lease term, the Company 
allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment or renew the lease based on mutually 
agreed upon terms. 
The Company retains a residual position in equipment through lease and finance agreements which is 
equivalent to an estimated market value. The residual amount is established prior to lease inception, based upon 
estimated equipment values at end of lease using product road map trends, historical analysis, future projections 
and remarketing experience. The Company's residual amounts are evaluated at least annually to assess the 
appropriateness of the carrying values. Any anticipated declines in specific future residual values that are 
considered to be other-than-temporary would be recorded in current earnings. The Company is able to optimize the 
recovery of residual values by selling equipment in place, extending lease arrangements on a fixed term basis, 
entering into a monthly usage rental term beyond the initial lease term, and selling lease returned equipment in the 
secondary market. The contractual lease agreement also identifies return conditions that ensures the leased 
equipment will be in good operating condition upon return minus any normal wear and tear. During the residual 
review process, product changes, product updates, as well as market conditions are reviewed and adjustments if 
other than temporary are made to residual values in accordance with the impact of any such changes. The 
remarketing sales organization closely manages the sale of equipment lease returns to optimize the recovery of 
outstanding residual by product. 
Business Combinations
The Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in the Company's consolidated results 
prospectively from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the 
assets acquired including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling 
interests in the acquired entity based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair 
value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. The excess of the fair 
value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling 
interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of 
the synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the value of the acquired assembled 
workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and post-
acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as 
incurred.
Goodwill
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the 
Company has the option to first perform a qualitative test to determine whether further impairment testing is 
necessary or to perform a qualitative assessment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying 
amount. Under the qualitative assessment, the Company is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
unless it determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying 
amount. Qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic and industry environment as well as 
Company-specific factors. The Company elects to perform a quantitative test for all of its reporting units as part of its 
annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
In the quantitative assessment, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of 
fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under 
the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

91


Page 94:
estimated future cash flows covering discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations. The 
Company prepares cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating 
margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The Company bases the discount rate on the 
weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and 
the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market 
approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from 
comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. 
The Company weights the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of 
comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not 
meaningful or not available, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income 
approach.
If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting 
unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its 
carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting 
unit's carrying value over its fair value (not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit).
Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives, long-lived assets and ROU assets for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For 
lease assets such circumstances would include a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset, or 
subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated lease. The Company assesses the recoverability of 
assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual 
disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is 
impaired. The Company measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, as the difference between the carrying 
amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market 
approach. The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the 
estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to ten years. Intangible assets purchased as part of an 
acquisition are included in Intangible assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All other separately 
purchased intangible assets are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. 
Software development costs related to the development of new product offerings are capitalized subsequent 
to the establishment of technological feasibility, which is demonstrated by the completion of a detail program design 
or working model. Software development costs are included in Intangible assets, net in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. The Company amortizes capitalized costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of products, 
which is generally three years. 
Equity Method Investments
Investments and ownership interests are accounted for under equity method accounting if the Company has 
the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company records 
its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses 
on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within Earnings from equity interests in the 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with its equity method investees 
are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of 
the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives 
of the related assets that gave rise to them. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; 
instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment. The Company records its interest in the net earnings 
of its equity method investments based on the most recently available financial statements of the investees. 
The carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect the Company's interest in net 
earnings, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments. The Company reviews for impairment 
whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the 
decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Equity Securities Investments
Equity securities investments with readily determinable fair values (other than those accounted for under the 
equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value and any changes in 
fair value are recognized in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For equity 
investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company may elect to apply the measurement alternative 
or the fair value option. Under the measurement alternative investments are measured at cost, less impairment, and 
adjusted for qualifying observable price changes on a prospective basis. The Company reviews for impairment at 
each reporting period, assessing factors such as deterioration of earnings, adverse change in market/industry 
conditions, the ability to operate as a going concern, and other factors which indicate that the carrying amount of the 
investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the 
impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company elects the fair value option when it 
believes that it best reflects the underlying economics of the investment. These investments may be valued using 
third-party pricing services at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Interest 
and other, net  in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Debt Securities Investments
Debt securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains 
and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the specific identification 
method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company monitors 
its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis. When the carrying amount of an investment in 
debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be due to credit-related factors, the 
Company recognizes the impairment using an allowance for credit loss in Interest and other, net, in the 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings, while the impairment that is not credit related is recorded in Accumulated 
other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivatives
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and, at times, options, to 
manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company 
does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  
The Company receives fair value to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. When prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset 
or liability, the Company generally uses industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of derivative 
positions. Such measurements involve projecting future cash flows and discounting the future amounts to present 
value using market based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, Company and counterparty credit risk, 
foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices. In the absence of such data, the Company will use 
internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that 
occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about 
assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, 
identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then 
making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability 
being valued.
For a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 12, “Fair Value” 
and Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” respectively.
Contingencies
The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary 
course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a 
liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not record 
gain contingencies until realized. See Note 17, “Litigation, Contingencies, and Commitments,” for a full description 
of the Company's contingencies.

Warranties
The Company accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of recognizing revenue. The 
Company's standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a 
product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. The Company engages in extensive product quality 
programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. The 
estimated warranty obligation is based on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost 
per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure 
outside of the Company's baseline experience. Warranty terms generally range from one to five years for parts and 
labor, depending upon the product. For certain networking products, the Company offers a lifetime warranty. Over 
the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately 1.1% of annual net product 
revenue. Refer to Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” for additional information.
Recently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance to provide disaggregated expense disclosures in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is required to adopt the guidance for its annual period ending 
October 31, 2028 and all interim periods thereafter, though early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently 
evaluating the impact of this amendment on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to provide disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate 
reconciliation and income taxes paid. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 
2026, though early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable 
segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable 
segment’s expenses. The Company will adopt this guidance for its annual period ending October 31, 2025 and all 
interim periods thereafter. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact 
on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 2: Segment Information
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's operations are organized into five segments for financial reporting purposes: 
Server, Hybrid Cloud, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services (“FS”), and Corporate Investments and Other. Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (“CODM”), who is the Chief Executive Officer, uses to evaluate, view and run the Company's business 
operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The 
five segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's 
management to evaluate segment results. A summary of the types of products and services within each segment is 
as follows:

which primarily offers consultative-led services, HPE and partner technology expertise and advice, implementation 
services as well as complex solution engagement capabilities; CMS, which primarily offers software and related 
services to the telecommunications industry; and Hewlett Packard Labs, which is responsible for research and 
development.
Segment Policy
Hewlett Packard Enterprise derives the results of its business segments directly from its internal management 
reporting system. The accounting policies that Hewlett Packard Enterprise uses to derive segment results are 
substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. The CODM measures the performance of each 
segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. The CODM uses these results, in part, to 
evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to each of the segments.
Segment revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that reflect 
transactions between the segments on an arm's-length basis. Intersegment revenues primarily consist of sales of 
hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as operating 
leases by FS to the Company's customers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's consolidated net revenue is derived and 
reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.
Financing cost in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on borrowing and 
funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries, and debt issued by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for 
which a portion of the proceeds benefited FS.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at 
the corporate level. These unallocated operating costs include certain corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based 
compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster 
recovery/charges, divestiture related exit costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Total assets 
by segment are not presented as that information is not used to allocate resources or assess performance at the 
segment level and is not reviewed by the CODM.

Note 3: Transformation Programs 
Transformation programs are comprised of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and the HPE Next 
Plan. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company launched the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan 
which focuses on realigning the workforce to areas of growth, a new hybrid workforce model called Edge-to-Office, 
real estate strategies and simplifying and evolving the Company’s product portfolio strategy. The transformation 
costs predominantly related to labor restructuring, non-labor restructuring, IT investments, design and execution 
charges and real estate initiatives. The primary elements of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan were 
completed by the end of fiscal 2024.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company launched the HPE Next Plan to put in place a purpose-
built company designed to compete and win in the markets where it participates. Through this program, the 
Company is simplifying the operating model, and streamlining its offerings, business processes and business 
systems to improve its strategy execution. The primary elements of the HPE Next Plan were completed by the end 
of fiscal 2024.

Restructuring Plans
On May 19, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the Cost 
Optimization and Prioritization Plan which primarily related to labor restructuring and real estate site exits under 
non-labor restructuring. The changes to the workforce varied by country, based on business needs, local legal 
requirements and consultations with employee works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate.  
On October 16, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the 
HPE Next Plan, and on September 20, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a revision to that 
restructuring plan. Headcount exits under the HPE Next Plan were substantially complete as of October 31, 2020.

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 
Defined Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans worldwide, the most significant of which are the United 
Kingdom (“UK”) and Germany plans. The pension plan in the UK is closed to new entrants, and the plan was frozen 
October 31, 2024. This plan provides benefits based on final pay and years of service and generally requires 
contributions from members. The German pension program that is open to new hires consists of cash balance plans 
that provide employer credits as a percentage of pay, certain employee pay deferrals and employer matching 
contributions. There also are previously closed German pension programs that include cash balance and final 
average pay plans. These previously closed pension programs comprise the majority of the pension obligations in 
Germany. 
Post-Retirement Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, the most significant of which is in the U.S. 
Generally, employees hired before August 2008 are eligible for employer credits under the Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (“RMSA”) upon attaining age 45. Employer credits to the 
RMSA available after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made 
to a voluntary employee beneficiary association. Upon retirement, employees may use these employer credits for 
the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses.
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Company’s 
defined contribution expense was approximately $206 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, and $196 million in fiscal 
2022. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan (“HPE 
401(k) Plan”), when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. The HPE 401(k) Plan’s 
quarterly employer matching contributions are 100% of an employee’s contributions, up to a maximum of 4% of 
eligible compensation. 
Pension Benefit Expense
The Company's net pension and post-retirement benefit costs that were directly attributable to the eligible 
employees, retirees and other former employees of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and recognized in the Consolidated 
Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 are presented in the table below.

(1) The average assumed interest credited for HPE's cash balance plans and post-retirement plans, as applicable.
To estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit plans that 
use the yield curve approach, which represent substantially all of the Company's defined benefit plans, the 
Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by 
applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the 
relevant projected cash flows.

For the year ended October 31, 2024 , the benefit obligation increased from $9.4 billion to $10.3 billion 
primarily due to the effects of decreasing discount rates. The increase was partially offset by benefits paid which 
reduced benefit obligations. Pension assets increased from $9.9 billion to $11.0 billion as assets performed better 
than expected. The increase was partially offset by benefits paid from plan assets.

(1) Repurchase agreements, primarily in the UK, represent the plans’ short-term borrowing to hedge against interest rate and 
inflation risks. Investments in approximately $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion of government bonds collateralize this short-term 
borrowing at October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The plans have an obligation to return the cash after the term of the 
agreements. Due to the short-term nature of the agreements, the outstanding balance of the obligation approximates fair 
value.
(2) Includes funds that invest primarily in asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, 
and/or private debt investments. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and 
broker quotes and/or third-party pricing services. Significant unobservable inputs include yields which are determined by 
considering the market yield of comparable public debt instruments adjusted for estimated losses to reflect where the 
expected recovery rate would be less than 100%, discount rates, and internal rate of return (IRR). The yields ranged from 
6% to 21%, with the weighted average around 10%. In the prior year, the yields ranged from 6% to 22%, with the weighted 
average around 10%. The discount rates ranged from 3% to 5%, with the weighted average around 4%. In the prior year, the 
discount rates ranged from 4% to 5%, with the weighted average around 4%. The IRR ranged from 1% to 38%, with the 
main weighted average around 9%. In the prior year, the IRR ranged from 5% to 21%, with the main weighted average 
around 10%. Generally, an increase in yield and discounted rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain 
investments.

(3) Includes funds, primarily in the UK, held in non-marketable, limited partnership interests which invest in a broad range of 
infrastructure and infrastructure-related assets. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include the market, 
income or cost approach. Significant unobservable inputs include discount rate and EV/EBITDA multiples. Discount rates 
ranged from 8% to 13%, with the weighted average around 10%. The EV/EBITDA multiples ranged from 6.5x to 37.9x, with 
the weighted average ranging from 9.2x to 36.3x. Generally, an increase in discount rates may result in a decrease in the 
fair value of certain investments. The EV/EBITDA ratio generally indicates the number of times investors are willing to pay 
for a company's EBITDA valuation.
(4) Includes funds, primarily in the UK, that invest in both private and public equities, as well as emerging markets across all 
sectors. The funds also hold fixed income and derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and inflation risk. In addition, the 
funds include units in transferable securities, collective investment schemes, money market funds, asset-backed income, 
cash, and deposits. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and book value or 
net asset value. Significant unobservable inputs include discount rates. The discount rates ranged from 3% to 38%, with the 
weighted average around 17%. In the prior year, the discount rates ranged from 3% to 28%, with the weighted average 
around 14%. Generally, an increase in discount rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.
(5) Includes a pooled fund in the UK, that seeks a rate of return with direct or indirect linkage to UK inflation by investing in 
vehicles including bonds, long lease property, income strips, asset-backed securities, and index linked assets. Units are 
available for subscription on the first business day of each calendar month at net asset value. There are no redemption 
restrictions or future commitments on these investments. 
(6) Common Contractual Funds are investment arrangements in which institutional investors pool their assets. Units may be 
acquired in four different sub-funds focused on equities, fixed income, alternative investments, and emerging markets. Each 
sub-fund is invested in accordance with the fund's investment objective and units are issued in relation to each sub-
fund. While the sub-funds are not publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value either once or twice a month, 
depending on the sub-fund. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.
(7) Includes funds, primarily in Germany, that invest in a diversified portfolio of European real estate assets exposed to logistics 
real estate properties, food retailing properties, residential and commercial properties, and properties under development. 
Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include the income capitalization approach and cost approach. 
Significant unobservable inputs include rental yield and IRR. The rental yield rates ranged from 4% to 7%, with the weighted 
average around 5%. In the prior year, the rental yield rates ranged from 4% to 6%, with the weighted average around 4%. 
The IRR ranged from 0% to 4%, with the main weighted average around 1%. In the prior year, the IRR ranged from 5% to 
8%, with the main weighted average around 7%. Generally, an increase in rental yield rates may result in a decrease in the 
fair value of certain investments. A higher IRR generally signifies a greater fair value as it implies a greater potential rate of 
return over the life of an investment.
(8) Includes life insurance investment policies, unsettled transactions, and derivative instruments. As of October 31, 2024, the 
derivative instruments include synthetic equity swaps held by the UK plans with equity exposure of $396 million.
As of October 31, 2024 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $76 million were invested in publicly traded 
registered investment entities of which $61 million are classified within Level 1 and $15 million within Level 2 of the 
fair value hierarchy. As of October 31, 2023 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $68 million were invested in 
publicly traded registered investment entities of which $55 million are classified within Level 1 and $13 million within 
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Changes in fair value measurements of Level 3 investments for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans were as

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value. 
Investments in publicly traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as 
reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. For corporate, government backed 
debt securities, and some other investments, fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market 
transactions. The valuation of certain real estate funds, insurance group annuity contracts and alternative 
investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment and 
involves a level of uncertainty. The valuation is generally based on fair value as reported by the asset manager and 
adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by 
management, including, but are not limited to, the timeliness of fair value as reported by the asset manager and 
changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last fair value reported by the asset 
manager. The use of different techniques or assumptions to estimate fair value could result in a different fair value 
measurement at the reporting date. Cash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued 
based on cost, which approximates fair value. Other than those assets that have quoted prices from an active 
market, investments are generally classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety. Investments measured using net asset value as 
a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.
Plan Asset Allocations 
The weighted-average target and actual asset allocations across the benefit plans at the respective 
measurement dates for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans were as follows:
 Defined Benefit Plans

For the Company's post-retirement benefit plans, approximately 80% of the plan assets are invested in cash 
and cash equivalents and approximately 20% in multi-asset credit investments which consists primarily of 
investment grade credit, emerging market debt and high yield bonds.
Investment Policy
The Company's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of 
risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the 
plans’ investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the 
broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and 
investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans’ investment 
managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and the Company may utilize 
derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures.
Asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. 
Investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In 
some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of 
investment in fixed income securities than would otherwise be deployed. The Company reviews the investment 
strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on 
asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees or investment committees for the specific 
plan.
Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class 
in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the 
current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns, which considers 
each country’s specific inflation outlook. Because the Company’s investment policy is to employ primarily active 
investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted to reflect the 
expected additional returns, net of fees.
Employer Contributions and Funding Policy
During fiscal 2024, the Company contributed approximately $172 million to its non-U.S. pension plans and 
paid $4 million to cover benefit claims under the Company’s post-retirement benefit plans.
During fiscal 2025, the Company expects to contribute approximately $189 million to its non-U.S. pension 
plans and an additional $1 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. In addition, the 
Company expects to pay approximately $6 million to cover benefit claims for its post-retirement benefit plans. The 
Company's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by various 
authorities including local government and taxing authorities.
Estimated Future Benefits Payments
As of October 31, 2024, estimated future benefits payments for the Company's retirement plans were as

Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation
On April 14, 2021 (the “Approval Date”), shareholders of the Company approved the Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise Company 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) that replaced the Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive 
Plan (the “2015 Plan”). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of various types of awards including restricted stock 
awards, stock options and performance-based awards. These awards generally vest over 3 years from the grant 
date. The maximum number of shares as of the Approval Date that may be delivered to the participants under the 
2021 Plan shall not exceed 7 million shares, plus 35.8 million shares that were available for grant under the 2015 
Plan and any awards granted under the 2015 Plan prior to the Approval Date that were cash-settled, forfeited, 
terminated, or lapsed after the Approval Date. On April 5, 2022, April 5, 2023 and April 10, 2024, shareholders of the 
Company approved amendments to the 2021 Plan thereby increasing the overall number of shares available for 
issuance by 15 million shares, 18 million shares, and 22 million shares, respectively. As of October 31, 2024, the 
Company had remaining authorization of 38.5 million shares under the 2021 Plan. 
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Stock-based compensation expense and the resulting tax benefits were as follows:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Effective November 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2015 Employee 
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The total number of shares of Company's common stock authorized under the 
ESPP was 80 million. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their eligible compensation to 
purchase Hewlett Packard Enterprise's common stock. The ESPP provides for a discount not to exceed 15% and 
an offering period up to 24 months. The Company currently offers 6-month offering periods during which employees 
have the ability to purchase shares at 95% of the closing market price on the purchase date. No stock-based 
compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases, as the criteria of a non-compensatory 
plan were met.
Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. 
Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock 
units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The fair value of the restricted stock units is the closing 
price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company expenses the fair value of 
restricted stock units ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.

The total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested for Company employees in fiscal 2024, 2023, 
and 2022 was $348 million, $319 million and $262 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2024, there was $342 
million of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units, which 
the Company expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.3 years.
Performance Restricted Units 
 The Company issues performance stock units (“PSU”) that vest on the satisfaction of service and 
performance conditions. The fair value of the PSUs is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the 
grant date of the award. The Company also issues performance-adjusted restricted stock units (“PARSU”) that vest 
only on the satisfaction of service, performance and market conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of 
PARSUs subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The 
expenses associated with these performance restricted units were not material for any of the periods presented.
Stock Options
Stock options granted under the Plan are generally non-qualified stock options, but the Plan permits some 
options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The exercise price of a 
stock option is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the option grant date. The majority of 
the stock options issued by the Company contain only service vesting conditions. The Company has also issued 
performance-contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions. The 
Company did not issue stock options in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022. The expenses associated with stock options 
were not material for any of the periods presented. 
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock 
options subject to service-based vesting conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options subject 
to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice 
model, as these awards contain market conditions.

The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on the Company's effective tax 
rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.
In fiscal 2024, the Company recorded $43 million of net income tax charges related to various items discrete 
to the year. These amounts primarily included $104 million of income tax charges resulting from the gain on the 
partial disposition of H3C Technologies Co., Limited (“H3C”), which included $215 million of U.S. and foreign income 
tax charges offset by $111 million of income tax benefit for the release of an uncertain tax benefit related to the prior 
divestiture, partially offset by $54 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, 
disposition and other related charges and $11 million  of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based 
compensation.
In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded $131 million of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete 
to the year. These amounts primarily included $104 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, 
and acquisition, disposition and other related charges and $19 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-
based compensation.
In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $454 million of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete 
to the year. These amounts primarily included $150 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign 
valuation allowances, $99 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition 
and other related charges, $43 million of income tax benefits related to the settlement of U.S. tax audit matters, $42 
million of income tax benefits related to the release of U.S. passive foreign tax credit valuation allowances, $30

million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the 
Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc., $27 
million of income tax benefits related to the utilization of capital losses which had a full valuation allowance, $12 
million of income tax benefits as a result of the fiscal 2021 U.S. tax return filing primarily from the decrease in GILTI, 
and $11 million of net income tax benefits related to settlements and ongoing discussions in foreign tax audit 
matters. 
As a result of certain employment actions and capital investments the Company has undertaken, income from 
manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates through 2039. The gross foreign 
income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were $356 million ($0.27 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 
2024, $857 million ($0.65 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2023, and $832 million ($0.63 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2022.

Up to $344 million, $354 million and $386 million of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, would affect its effective tax rate if realized in their respective periods. During 
the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company effectively settled with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for 
fiscal 2016, primarily contributing to the reduction in the Company's unrecognized tax benefits of $1.5 billion, which 
was predominantly related to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition which does not affect the 
Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties 
accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings . The 
Company recognized $2 million of interest expense and $25 million and $55 million of interest income in fiscal 2024, 
2023, and 2022, respectively. As of October 31, 2024  and 2023, the Company had accrued $58 million and 
$56 million, respectively, for interest and penalties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately 80 other countries and is subject to 
routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.
The Company engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters 
in various jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax audits for years prior to 2017. The IRS 
is conducting audits of the Company's fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income tax returns. During fiscal 2023, 
the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments (“NOPAs”) for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 relating to HPE’s 
intercompany transfer pricing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report 
(“RAR”) finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal years. However, HPE disagreed 
with the IRS’ adjustments and believes the positions taken on its tax returns are more likely than not to prevail on 
technical merits, and has continued with settlement discussions with the IRS. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Page 114:
the Company submitted a formal settlement offer to the IRS to facilitate the closing of the audit and recorded 
increased reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $122 million. The impact of the increase in reserves is almost 
entirely offset with a valuation allowance release, and the net impact to income tax expense for fiscal 2024 was not 
material. It is reasonably possible that the IRS audit for fiscal 2017 through 2019 may be concluded in the next 12 
months, and it is reasonably possible that existing unrecognized tax benefits related to these years may be reduced 
by an amount up to $358 million within the next 12 months, the majority of which relates to adjustments to foreign 
tax credits that carry a full valuation allowance or to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition, neither 
of which affects the Company’s effective tax rate.
With respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is no longer subject to tax authority 
examinations for years prior to 2005. However, it is reasonably possible that certain foreign tax issues may be 
concluded in the next 12 months, including issues involving resolution of certain intercompany transactions and 
other matters. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be 
reduced by an amount up to $6 million within the next 12 months.
The Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits 
that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of 
these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of the Company's tax provision. The Company adjusts its 
uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other 
information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and 
there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts 
ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the 
Provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could 
have a material impact on net earnings or cash flows.
The Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income and foreign withholding taxes on $9.3 billion 
of undistributed earnings and basis differences from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2024  because the 
Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of 
unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings and basis differences is not practicable. The Company 
will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and 
foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and the Company determines 
that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.
Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities 
recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.

Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contract work that has not yet been 
performed and does not include contracts where the customer is not committed. Remaining performance obligations 
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including contract terminations, changes in the 
scope of contracts, adjustments for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency. As of 
October 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of deferred revenue, was $7.5 billion. The Company expects to recognize 
approximately 50% of this balance over fiscal 2025 with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The Company 
receives payments in advance of completion of its contractual obligations, these payments are considered customer 
deposits. As customer acceptance milestones are met, the Company will recognize revenue and reduce the amount 
of contract liabilities. As of October 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of customer deposits was $296 million. The 
Company expects to recognize $289 million over fiscal 2025 and the remaining balance thereafter.

Financing Receivables
Financing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases of the Company and third-party 
products. These receivables typically have terms ranging from two to five years and are usually collateralized by a 
security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from operating 
leases. The allowance for credit losses represents future expected credit losses over the life of the receivables 
based on past experience, current information and forward-looking economic considerations. The components of 
financing receivables were as follows:

Sale of Financing Receivables
The Company enters into arrangements to transfer the contractual payments due under certain financing 
receivables to third-party financial institutions. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company 
sold $93 million and $237 million, respectively, of financing receivables. 
Credit Quality Indicators
Due to the homogeneous nature of its leasing transactions, the Company manages its financing receivables 
on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large 
number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries 
and geographic regions. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that 
credit quality over the term of a transaction. The Company assigns risk ratings to each lease based on the 
creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular 
transaction and periodically updates the risk ratings when there is a change in the underlying credit quality. Such 
variables include the underlying value and liquidity of the collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of 
the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.
The credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2024, 
presented on amortized cost basis by year of origination was as follows:

Accounts rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB– or higher, while 
accounts rated moderate risk generally have the equivalent of BB+ or lower. The Company classifies accounts as 
high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes there is a 
significant near-term risk of impairment. The credit quality indicators do not reflect any mitigation actions taken to 
transfer credit risk to third parties.

Variable Interest Entities
The Company has issued asset-backed debt securities under a fixed-term securitization program to private 
investors. The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized by the U.S. fixed-term financing receivables and 
leased equipment in the offering, which is held by a Special Purpose Entity (“SPE”). The SPE meets the definition of 
a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) and is consolidated, along with the associated debt, into the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The SPE is a bankruptcy-remote legal entity with 
separate assets and liabilities. The purpose of the SPE is to facilitate the funding of customer receivables and 
leased equipment in the capital markets.  
The Company's risk of loss related to securitized receivables and leased equipment is limited to the amount by 
which the Company's right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, 
principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities. 
The following table presents the assets and liabilities held by the consolidated VIE as of October 31, 2024 and 
2023, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The assets in the table below include those that can

The excess of fair value over carrying amount for the reporting units ranged from approximately 8% to 
198% of the respective carrying amounts and;
• Interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024 for Compute and Hybrid Cloud reporting units.
In September 2024, HPE sold 30% of the total issued share capital of  H3C. The equity investment in H3C 
primarily benefits the Compute and Hybrid Cloud reporting units. Subsequent to the sale, on September 30, 2024, 
the Company performed an interim impairment analysis for Compute and Hybrid Cloud reporting units. The excess 
of fair value over carrying amount for these reporting units was 6% for Compute and 5% for Hybrid Cloud.  
The Compute reporting unit has goodwill of $8.2 billion as of October 31, 2024, and excess of fair value over 
carrying value of 6% as of the September 30, 2024 interim test date. The Compute business is cyclical in nature. 
Over the last several years, digital transformation drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, 
in the current macroeconomic and inflationary environment, customers have invested selectively resulting in 
moderate unit growth and competitive pricing. The Compute business continues to focus on capturing market share 
while maintaining operating margin, leveraging its strong portfolio of ProLiant Gen11 products.
The Hybrid Cloud reporting unit has goodwill of $4.8 billion as of October 31, 2024, and excess of fair value of 
5% as of the September 30, 2024 interim test date. Although the Hybrid Cloud business is on a positive trajectory, 
the Company is managing both a sales model transition and product transition within this business. The Company’s 
product model transition is to a more cloud-native, software-defined platform with HPE Alletra. Translating this 
growth to revenue and operating income will take time because a greater mix of high margin business such as 
ratable software and services, are deferred and recognized in future periods.
2023 and 2022 Annual Goodwill Impairment Reviews
The Company’s fiscal 2023 annual impairment test did not result in any impairment charges.
The Company’s fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill 
related to the HPC & AI reporting unit and former Software reporting unit (which is now part of the Hybrid Cloud 
reporting unit). There was no impairment of goodwill for other reporting units. 
The decline in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit below its carrying value resulted from changes in 
expected future cash flows due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational challenges as 
well as an increase in cost of capital. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $815 million was recorded in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The decline in the fair value of the former Software reporting unit resulted primarily 
from a decline in market multiples. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $90 million was recorded in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

For fiscal 2024, the decrease in gross intangible assets was primarily due to $761 million of intangible assets 
which became fully amortized and were eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization, 
partially offset by $68 million of intangible assets related to acquisitions and $56 million related to capitalized 
software development costs.
As of October 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company's finite-lived intangible

Note 12: Fair Value
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit 
price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. 
Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the 
assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information 
available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value 
hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar 
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable 
for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable 
inputs. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no transfers between levels within the fair 
value hierarchy.

Valuation Techniques
Cash Equivalents and Investments: The Company holds time deposits, money market funds, debt securities 
primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds. The Company values cash equivalents 
using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market 
observable inputs. The fair value of debt and equity investments was based on quoted market prices or model-
driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain 
instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data. 
Equity and other securities include investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. In evaluating non-
marketable securities for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses valuation techniques using 
the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash 
flow projections. 
Derivative Instruments: The Company uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps to hedge 
certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company uses industry standard valuation models to 
measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to 
present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, the Company and 
counterparties' credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest 
rates. See Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” for a further discussion of the Company's use of derivative instruments.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
  Short-Term and Long-Term Debt: The Company estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an 
expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently 
available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its own 
credit risk. The portion of the Company's debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an 
amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. As of October 31, 2024, the estimated 
fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $18.3 billion and the carrying value was $18.2 billion. 
As of October 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $12.2 billion 
and the carrying value was $12.4 billion. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short-term 
and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Other Financial Instruments: For the balance of the Company's financial instruments, primarily accounts 
receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts 
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, 
these other financial instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements
Equity Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Value: Equity investments are recorded at cost and 
measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price 
changes. For fiscal 2024, the Company recorded a net unrealized gain of $34 million. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the 
Company recorded net unrealized losses of $45 million and $17 million, respectively, which included impairments of 
$50 million and $24 million for the same respective periods. These amounts are reflected in Interest and other, net 
in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these 
would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. These adjustments are based on observable 
price changes for certain equity investments without readily determinable fair value. For investments still held as of 
October 31, 2024, the cumulative upward adjustments for observable price changes was $82 million and cumulative 
downward adjustments for observable price changes and impairments was $88 million. Refer to Note 13 “Financial 
Instruments,” for further information about equity investments.
Non-Financial Assets: The Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, 
plant and equipment, are recorded at cost. The Company records ROU assets based on the lease liability, adjusted 
for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fair value adjustments are 
made to these non-financial assets in the period an impairment charge is recognized. 
  In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a net ROU asset impairment charge of $18 million and 
$5 million, respectively, in Transformation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as the carrying value of 
certain ROU assets exceeded its fair value. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these 
would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $905 million 
associated with the HPC & AI reporting unit and the Software reporting unit within the Corporate Investments and 
Other segment. The fair value of the Company's reporting units was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 
due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. For more information 
on the goodwill impairment, see Note 11, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets.”

Equity Investments
Non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies are included in Long-term financing 
receivables and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These non-marketable equity investments are 
carried either at fair value or under measurement alternative. Measurement alternative equity investments are 
recorded at cost and measured at fair value when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment 
from observable price changes.
The carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the fair value option 
was $88 million and $135 million as of October 31, 2024  and 2023, respectively. For fiscal 2024, he Company 
recorded a net unrealized loss of $47 million on these investments. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company 
recorded net unrealized gains of $9 million and $86 million, respectively on these investments. These amounts are 
reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In fiscal 2022, the Company sold 
$165 million of these investments. 
The carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement 
alternative was $200 million and $145 million as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For fiscal 2024, the 
Company recorded a net unrealized gain of $34 million. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded net

unrealized losses of $45 million and $17 million, respectively, which included impairments of $50 million and 
$24 million  for the same respective periods. These amounts are reflected in Interest and other, net in the 
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Derivative Instruments
The Company is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate 
changes in the normal course of its business. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative 
instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign 
currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. The Company's objective is to offset gains and 
losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, 
thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. The Company does not 
have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company may 
designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency 
exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment hedges”). Additionally, for derivatives not 
designated as hedging instruments, the Company categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. 
Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in fair value of 
the derivative instruments is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Consolidated Statements of 
Comprehensive Income depending upon the type of hedge as further discussed below. The Company classifies 
cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
As a result of its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will 
fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only 
entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and 
other factors, and the Company maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institution's credit rating 
and other factors. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include reviewing 
and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties. 
Master netting agreements also mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting the Company to net 
amounts due from the Company to a counterparty against amounts due to the Company from the same 
counterparty under certain conditions.
To further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, the Company has collateral security agreements, which 
allows the Company to hold collateral from, or require the Company to post collateral to counterparties when 
aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit 
ratings of the Company and its counterparties. If the Company's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the 
counterparty has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Conversely, if the 
counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the Company has the right to request full 
collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Collateral is generally posted within two business days. The 
fair value of the Company's derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $23 million and 
$108 million at October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, most of which were fully collateralized within two business 
days.
Under the Company's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a 
covered change of control event affecting the Company that results in the surviving entity being rated below a 
specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect the Company's financial position or cash flows 
as of October 31, 2024 and 2023.
Fair Value Hedges
The Company issues long-term debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. The 
Company may enter into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio 
to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based 
floating interest rate which was replaced with SOFR starting in July of fiscal 2023. The swap transactions generally 
involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, the Company may 
choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a 
larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments, the Company may

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
132


Page 135:
enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may 
designate these swaps as fair value hedges.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the 
change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged 
item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency 
exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, 
and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's foreign currency cash 
flow hedges mature generally within twelve months; however, forward contracts associated with sales-type and 
direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which can extend 
up to five years.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, and as long as they remain 
highly effective, the Company records the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in Accumulated other 
comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently 
reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the same financial statement line item when the hedged transaction is 
recognized. 
In connection with the Company’s pending acquisition of Juniper Networks and related debt issuances, the 
Company entered into interest rate locks for an aggregate notional amount of $2.6 billion. These contracts were 
settled in fiscal 2024, the Company recognized a loss of $42 million in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in 
certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. The Company records the changes in 
the fair value of the hedged items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of equity in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge 
foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. The Company also uses total return swaps, based on 
equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability.
For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes changes in fair 
value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest 
and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.
Hedge Effectiveness
For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by 
offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged items with the change in fair value of the derivative. For forward 
contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by 
comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the 
hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates.

Offsetting of Derivative Instruments
The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
Company's derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements. 
The Company does not offset the fair value of its derivative instruments against the fair value of cash collateral 
posted under collateral security agreements. The information related to the potential effect of the Company's use of 
the master netting agreements and collateral security agreements were as follows:

As disclosed in Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” the Company used interest rate swaps to mitigate the 
exposure of its fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the 
variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with its variable-rate debt. Interest rates on long-term 
debt in the table above have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any interest rate swaps.
Commercial Paper
 Hewlett Packard Enterprise maintains two commercial paper programs, “the Parent Programs,” and a wholly-
owned subsidiary maintains a third program. The Parent Program in the U.S. provides for the issuance of U.S. 
dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $4.75 billion. The Parent 
Program outside the U.S. provides for the issuance of commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or 
British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative 
currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those two programs 
at any one time cannot exceed the $4.75 billion as authorized by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Board of Directors. In 
addition, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise subsidiary's euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Program 
provides for the issuance of commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal 
amount of $1.0 billion. As of October 31, 2024  and 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the Parent 
Programs. As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, $649 million and $679 million, respectively, were outstanding under 
the subsidiary’s program.
Revolving Credit Facility
In September 2024, the Company terminated its prior senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was 
entered into in December 2021, and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate 
lending commitment of $5.25 billion for a period of five years. The commitment comprised of (i) $4.75 billion of 
commitments available immediately and (ii) $500 million of commitments available from and subject to the closing of 
the Juniper Networks acquisition and refinancing of Juniper Networks’ credit agreement in connection with the 
closing of the Juniper Networks acquisition. As of October 31, 2024 and 2023, no borrowings were outstanding 
under either credit facilities. 
Uncommitted Credit facility
On September 21, 2023, the Company entered into a five-year agreement with Societe Generale for an 
uncommitted short-term cash advance facility in the principal amount of up to $500 million. As of October 31, 2024, 
no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility.
Juniper Networks Acquisition Committed Financing
In connection with HPE’s signing a definitive agreement to acquire Juniper Networks in January 2024 (the 
“Merger Agreement”), HPE entered into a commitment letter whereby HPE obtained a commitment from Citigroup 
Global Markets Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for a $14.0 billion senior unsecured

delayed draw term loan facility, comprised of an $11.0 billion 364-day tranche and a $3.0 billion three-year tranche, 
subject to customary conditions (the “Term Loan Commitment Letter”).
In September 2024, HPE issued $9.0 billion of senior unsecured notes. In addition, in furtherance of the Term 
Loan Commitment Letter, the Company entered into term loan agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, 
Citibank, N.A., and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for approximately $12.0 billion of senior unsecured delayed draw term loan 
facilities, comprised of an approximately $9.0 billion 364-day tranche and a $3.0 billion three-year tranche, subject 
to customary conditions. The Company has since further reduced the commitments under the 364-day term loan to 
$1.0 billion. Unless previously terminated, commitments under both the 364-day term loan and the three-year term 
loan will terminate upon the earliest of (i) five business days after the Juniper Outside Date (as defined in such term 
loan agreements), (ii) the occurrence of the closing of the acquisition of Juniper Networks without the funding of any 
borrowings under either of the term loan agreements, and (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement by HPE in 
writing in accordance with its terms. As of October 31, 2024 , no borrowings were outstanding and HPE paid 
$42 million of financing fees.
In connection with the entry into the aforementioned 364-day term loan and the three-year term loan, on 
September 12, 2024, HPE terminated the Term Loan Commitment Letter.
Future Maturities of Borrowings
As of October 31, 2024, aggregate future maturities of the Company's borrowings at face value (excluding a 
fair value adjustment related to hedged debt of $58 million, a net discount of $53 million and unamortized debt 
issuance costs of $76 million), including finance lease obligations were as follows:

7.625% Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock
In September 2024, the Company issued 30 million  shares of 7.625% Series C Mandatory Convertible 
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 
less issuance costs of $38 million . As of October 31, 2024 , 30 million  shares of the Preferred Stock were 
outstanding.
Unless converted earlier in accordance with its terms, each share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert 
on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be September 1, 2027, into between 2.5352 shares and 
3.1056 shares of common stock, in each case, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments described in the 
certificate of designations related to the Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designations”). The number of shares of 
common stock issuable upon conversion will be determined based on the average volume weighted average price 
per share of common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including, the 21st 
scheduled trading day immediately prior to September 1, 2027.
Holders of shares of Preferred Stock have the option to convert all or any portion of their shares of Preferred 
Stock at any time. The conversion rate applicable to any early conversion may, in certain circumstances, be 
increased to compensate holders of the Preferred Stock for unpaid accumulated dividends as described in the 
Certificate of Designations.
If a Fundamental Change, as defined in the Certificate of Designations, occurs on or prior to September 1, 
2027, then holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to convert all or any portion of their Preferred Stock at the 
Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, into between 1.9200 shares and 3.1056 shares of common stock, in all 
cases, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments described in the Certificate of Designations, for a specified 
period of time and to also receive an amount to compensate them for unpaid accumulated dividends and any 
remaining future scheduled dividend payments. The Preferred Stock is not subject to redemption at the Company’s 
option.
Dividends

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Page 143:
The stockholders of HPE common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board 
of Directors. The Company’s ability to pay dividends will depend on many factors, such as its financial condition, 
earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants in its debt, industry practice, legal 
requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Furthermore, so 
long as any share of its Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend on shares of common stock (or any other 
class of stock junior to the Preferred Stock) shall be declared or paid unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends 
for all preceding dividend periods for the Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full in cash, shares of the 
Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, or a sufficient sum of cash or number of shares of its common 
stock has been set apart for the payment of such dividends, on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock. 
Dividends declared were $0.52 and $0.48 per common share in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.
On December 05, 2024, the Company declared a regular cash dividend of $0.13 per share on the Company's 
common stock, payable on January 16, 2025, to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on 
December 20, 2024.
Dividends on the Preferred Stock will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by the Board 
of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, at an annual rate of 7.625% on the liquidation of preference of 
$50.00 per share. The Company may pay declared dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of 
its common stock or in any combination of cash and shares of its common stock on March 1, June 1, September 1 
and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2024, and ending on, and including, September 1, 
2027. The Company has declared a cash dividend of $0.82604167 per share of its 7.625% Series C Mandatory 
Convertible Preferred Stock, which was paid on December 1, 2024, to holders of record as of the close of business 
on November 15, 2024.
Share Repurchase Program
On October 13, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with a $3.0 billion 
authorization, which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of $3.0 billion, $5.0 billion and 
$2.5 billion on May 24, 2016, October 16, 2017 and February 21, 2018, respectively. This program, which does not 
have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. 
In fiscal 2024, the Company repurchased and settled a total of 7.8 million shares under its share repurchase 
program through open market repurchases, which included 0.2 million shares that were unsettled open market 
repurchases as of October 31, 2023 . Additionally, the Company had unsettled open market repurchases of 
0.1 million  shares as of October 31, 2024 . Shares repurchased during the fiscal 2024 were recorded as a 
$150 million reduction to stockholders' equity. As of October 31, 2024, the Company had a remaining authorization 
of approximately $0.8 billion for future share repurchases. 
In fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased and settled a total of 27.2 million shares under its share repurchase 
program through open market repurchases, which included 0.3 million shares that were unsettled open market 
repurchases as of October 31, 2022 . Additionally, the Company had unsettled open market repurchases of 
0.2 million shares as of October 31, 2023. Shares repurchased during the fiscal 2023 were recorded as a $0.4 
billion reduction to stockholders' equity.

from the calculation of diluted net earnings per share, as their effect, if included, would have been anti-dilutive for the periods 
presented.
Note 17: Litigation, Contingencies, and Commitments
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including 
those consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits, and environmental 
matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as part of the Separation and Distribution 
Agreement (the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”) entered into in connection with Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise’s spin-off from HP Inc. (formerly known as “Hewlett-Packard Company”) (the “Separation”), Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related 
to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreement included provisions that allocate liability and 
financial responsibility for pending litigation involving the parties, as well as provide for cross-indemnification of the 
parties against liabilities to one party arising out of liabilities allocated to the other party. The Separation and 
Distribution Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and 
future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the Separation. Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the 
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of 
having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reviews these 
matters at least quarterly and adjusts these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, 
advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Litigation is 
inherently unpredictable. However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal 
matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any 
particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has 
recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2024, it was not reasonably possible that 
a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in its 
financial statements.

Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations
Ross and Rogus v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.  On November 8, 2018, a putative class action 
complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara alleging that HPE pays its California-
based female employees “systemically lower compensation” than HPE pays male employees performing 
substantially similar work. The complaint alleges various California state law claims, including California’s Equal Pay 
Act, Fair Employment and Housing Act, and Unfair Competition Law, and seeks certification of a California-only 
class of female employees employed in certain “Covered Positions.” The parties subsequently reached an 
agreement to resolve this class action. The terms of the settlement are reflected in Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary 
Approval of Class Action Settlement and Certification of Settlement Class, which was filed with the Court on 
September 26, 2022. On November 3, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion and preliminarily approved the 
terms of the class settlement, which defines the settlement class as all “[w]omen actively employed in California by 
Defendant at any point from November 1, 2015, through the date of Preliminary Approval” who were employed in a 
covered job code. The settlement class excludes certain individuals, including those who previously executed an 
arbitration agreement with HPE or an agreement that resulted in a release or waiver of claims. On April 28, 2023, 
the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of the Class Action Settlement and Certification of the 
Settlement Class. On February 6, 2024, the Court entered final judgment, approving the settlement and dismissing 
the action.
India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings. On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence (the “DRI”) issued notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd (“HP India”), a subsidiary 
of HP Inc., seven HP India employees and one former HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs 
duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately 
$370 million, plus penalties. On April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the 
products-related notices affirming  duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals for 
approximately $386 million. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the spare parts-related notice 
affirming duties and penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals for approximately $17 million. 
HP India filed appeals of the Commissioner’s orders before the Customs Tribunal. The Customs Department filed 
cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on 
the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The Customs Tribunal rejected HP India's request to return the 
matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings before the Customs Tribunal were subsequently 
delayed, have been postponed on several occasions since 2014, and have not yet been rescheduled.
ECT Proceedings. In January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos 
(“ECT”), notified a former subsidiary of HP Inc. in Brazil (“HP Brazil”) that it had initiated administrative proceedings 
to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the 
bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies 
allegedly coordinated their bids and fixed results for three ECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT 
notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and 
contract with ECT for five years, based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's 
decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and the administrative proceedings were closed with the 
penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against 
ECT seeking to have ECT’s decision revoked. HP Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of 
the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case, which was denied. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its 
request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a preliminary ruling denying the request 
for injunctive relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from five to two years. HP Brazil appealed that decision 
and, in December 2011, obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of 
the case. HP Brazil expects a resolution of the decision on the merits to take several years.
Forsyth, et al. vs. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. This purported class and collective action was filed 
on August 18, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against HP Inc. and 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging Defendants violated the Federal Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act (“ADEA”), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the 
California Business and Professions Code by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger 
workers. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide collective action under the ADEA comprised of individuals aged 40 
years and older who had their employment terminated by an HP entity pursuant to a work force reduction (“WFR”) 
plan. Plaintiffs also seek to certify a class under California law consisting of all persons 40 years or older employed

Page 146:
by Defendants in the state of California and terminated pursuant to a WFR plan on or after August 18, 2012. On 
April 14, 2021, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Class Certification was granted. The conditionally certified collective 
action consists of all individuals who had their employment terminated by Defendants pursuant to a WFR Plan on or 
after November 1, 2015, and who were 40 years or older at the time of such termination. The collective action 
excludes all individuals who signed a Waiver and General Release Agreement or an Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. 
The parties have reached an agreement to resolve this matter. Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Approval of 
the Class Action and Collective Action Settlement on September 21, 2023. On November 3, 2023, the Court issued 
an order granting preliminary approval to the Class Action and Collective Action Settlement. On March 29, 2024, the 
Court granted Final Approval to the settlement following a Fairness Hearing on the parties’ Motion for Final 
Approval. Judgment has been entered by the Court and the matter is now closed.
Q3 Networking Litigation. On September 21 and September 22, 2020, Q3 Networking LLC filed complaints 
against HPE, Aruba Networks, Commscope and Netgear in the United States District Court for the District of 
Delaware and the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”). Both complaints allege infringement of four 
patents, and the ITC complaint defines the “accused products” as “routers, access points, controllers, network 
management servers, other networking products, and hardware and software components thereof.” The ITC action 
was instituted on October 23, 2020. The District of Delaware action has been stayed pending resolution of the ITC 
action. On December 7, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination finding no violation of 
section 337 of the Tariff Act. On May 3, 2022, the ITC issued its Notice of Final Determination, affirming the initial 
determination and terminating the investigation. On June 18, 2022, Q3 Networking filed a petition for review of the 
ITC ruling with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 10, 2024, the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the ITC’s ruling in favor of HPE and Aruba Networks. Q3 Networking has 
not sought further review of the Federal Circuit’s ruling and HPE considers the matter closed.
R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation. In November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (“R2”) filed a lawsuit in the 
Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH, Hewlett-Packard GmbH, and other Intel 
customers. R2 asserts that one European patent is infringed by certain Intel processors and the HPE products that 
contain those Intel processors. On February 7, 2024, the Dusseldorf Regional Court ruled in R2’s favor, issuing an 
injunction that, if enforced by R2, would prevent the sale in Germany of any products with infringing Intel 
processors, and require HPE to correspond with its direct customers in Germany requesting return of the products 
with infringing Intel processors. The injunction would remain in place unless the ruling is overturned on appeal, the 
patent is invalidated by the German Federal Patent Court, or the matter is resolved by the parties. On February 8, 
2024, HPE, Intel, HP Inc., and Dell filed an appeal and request for a stay of the judgment pending appeal. On April 
9, 2024 the request for a stay pending appeal was denied. On April 3, 2024, R2 filed a lawsuit in France in the first 
instance court in Paris (Tribunal judiciare de Paris) against Intel Corporation, Intel Corporation SAS, Intel 
Deutschland GmbH, HP France SAS and certain other Intel customers. In May 2024, R2 filed suit in Milan against 
Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A., Hewlett-Packard Italiana S.r.l., and certain other Intel customers. R2 asserts the same 
European patent is infringed in both the French and Italian actions. On August 30, 2024, Intel and R2 publicly 
announced an agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies that would include dismissal of all 
litigation against all subsidiaries of HPE in the foregoing actions. Pursuant to that agreement, the Italian lawsuit was 
dismissed on September 2, 2024, the German lawsuit was dismissed on September 4, 2024, and the French 
Lawsuit was dismissed on September 6, 2024. These matters are now closed.
Shared Litigation with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus 
As part of the Separation and Distribution Agreements between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise and DXC, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Seattle SpinCo, the parties to each 
agreement agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' 
businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreements also included provisions that assign to the parties 
responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. (in the 
case of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from HP Inc.) or of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (in the case of 
the separation of DXC from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the separation of Seattle SpinCo from Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise), in each case arising prior to the applicable separation.
Environmental
The Company's operations and products are or may in the future become subject to various federal, state, 
local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of 
HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

pollutants into the air and water; supply chain due diligence, and sustainability, environment, and emissions-related 
reporting; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the clean-up of 
contaminated sites; product compliance and safety; the energy consumption of products, services, and operations; 
and the operational or financial responsibility for recycling, treatment, and disposal of those products. This includes 
legislation that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, subject to certain 
repairability requirements or financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past 
and future covered products (sometimes referred to as “product take-back legislation”). The Company could incur 
substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other 
sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, including those related to addressing 
climate change and other environmental related issues, or if its products become non-compliant with such 
environmental laws. The Company's potential exposure includes impacts on revenue, fines and civil or criminal 
sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of 
costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.
In particular, the Company may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or 
state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
(“CERCLA”), known as “Superfund,” or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations addressing the clean-up 
of contaminated sites, and may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties 
for contribution towards clean-up costs. The Company is also contractually obligated to make financial contributions 
to address actions related to certain environmental liabilities, both ongoing and arising in the future, pursuant to its 
Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc.
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
As of October 31, 2024, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $1.3 billion. 
These unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable 
and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to 
be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction, as well as 
settlements that the Company has reached with third parties, requiring it to pay determined amounts over a 
specified period of time. These unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, 
software maintenance and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude 
agreements that are cancellable without penalty. The Company expects the commitments to total $556 million, 
$368 million, $278 million, $68 million, and $13 million, for fiscal years 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, and 2029, 
respectively. There are no unconditional purchase obligations subsequent to fiscal year 2029.
Note 18: Guarantees and Indemnifications
Guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, 
customers and other parties pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the performance obligations of third 
parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the 
Company would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event 
occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material 
guarantee is remote.
The Company has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing 
arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of the Company's non-performance under the contract 
or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, the Company could, under certain circumstances, 
be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. The Company believes the likelihood of having 
to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.
The maximum potential future payments under performance guarantees and financing arrangements was 
$298 million as of October 31, 2024.

Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the 
Company may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the 
services they perform on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the 
particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. The Company 
also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement 
made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of the Company's software products and 
support services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. 
Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.
General Cross-indemnifications 
In connection with the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company entered into a Separation 
and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus respectively, whereby the Company agreed to 
indemnify HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and 
employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the 
liabilities allocated to the Company as part of the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions. Similarly, HP Inc., 
DXC and Micro Focus agreed to indemnify the Company, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective 
directors, officers and employees from and against all claims and liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting 
from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus as part of the Separation, 
Everett and Seattle Transactions. 
Tax Matters Agreement with DXC/Micro Focus and Other Income Tax Matters
In connection with the Everett Transaction and the Seattle Transaction, the Company entered into a Tax 
Matters Agreement with DXC and Micro Focus respectively (the “DXC Tax Matters Agreement” and the “Micro 
Focus Tax Matters Agreement”). The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement 
govern the rights and obligations of the Company and DXC/Micro Focus for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and 
tax receivables. The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement generally provide 
that the Company will be responsible for pre-divestiture tax liabilities and will be entitled to pre-divestiture tax 
receivables that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the Company's and DXC's, or Micro Focus', as 
applicable, U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax returns. In certain jurisdictions, the Company and DXC/Micro Focus have 
joint and several liability for past tax liabilities and accordingly, the Company could be legally liable under applicable 
tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.
In addition, if the distribution of Everett's or Seattle's common shares to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's 
stockholders is determined to be taxable, the Company would generally bear the tax liability, unless the taxability of 
the distribution is the direct result of actions taken by DXC/Micro Focus, in which case DXC/Micro Focus would be 
responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.
As of October 31, 2024  and 2023, the Company's receivable and payable balances related to indemnified 
litigation matters and other contingencies, and income tax-related indemnification covered by these agreements 
were as follows:
As of October 31,

matters, which may not be resolved for several years.

Note 19: Equity Interests
The Company includes investments which are accounted for using the equity method, under Investments in 
equity interests on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, Unisplendour 
International Technology Limited (“UNIS”), and H3C dated as of May 1, 2016, as amended from time to time, and 
most recently on October 28, 2022, the Company delivered a notice to UNIS on December 30, 2022, to exercise its 
right to put to UNIS, for cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by the Company, which represent 49% of the 
total issued share capital of H3C. On May 26, 2023, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries entered into a Put Share 
Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby UNIS has agreed to purchase all of the H3C shares held by the 
Company, through its subsidiaries. On May 24, 2024, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries entered into (i) an 
Amended and Restated Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby its relevant subsidiaries shall sell to 
UNIS 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C for pre-tax cash consideration of approximately $2.1 billion by 
August 31, 2024 (the “Sale Transaction”), and (ii) an Agreement on Subsequent Arrangements with UNIS, whereby 
upon closing of the Sale Transaction, the Company’s relevant subsidiary shall have a put option to sell to UNIS and 
UNIS shall have a call option to purchase from the Company’s relevant subsidiary 19% of the total issued share 
capital of H3C for pre-tax cash consideration of approximately $1.4 billion between the 16th month and until the 36th 
month after the Sale Transaction. The transactions referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) above, taken together, revise 
the arrangements governing the aforementioned sale of all of the H3C shares held by the Company, through its 
subsidiaries and are subject to certain grace periods and regulatory approvals. On September 4, 2024, pursuant to 
the Amended and Restated Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS (as described above), the Company 
received $2.1 billion of pre-tax consideration ($2.0 billion post-tax), in connection with the sale to UNIS of 30% of 
the total issued share capital of H3C resulting in a gain of $733 million. As of October 31, 2024 , the Company's 
Investments in equity interests was $929 million and primarily related to a 19% equity interest in H3C. As of October 
31, 2023, the Company's Investments in equity interests was $2.2 billion and primarily related to a 49% equity 
interest in H3C.
As of October 31, 2024, the difference between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in the net 
assets of the investment is $649 million. As of October 31, 2024  and 2023, the Company determined that no 
impairment of its equity method investments existed. 
Earnings from equity interests
The Company recorded earnings from equity interests of $147 million, $245 million and $215 million in fiscal 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the components of which are as 
follows:
For the fiscal years ended October 31,
2024 2023 2022
In millions
Earnings from equity interests, net of taxes $ 154 $ 242 $ 270 
Basis difference amortization  (3)  (9)  (45) 
Adjustment of profit on intra-entity sales  (4)  12  (10) 
Earnings from equity interests $ 147 $ 245 $ 215 
For fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Company received a cash dividend of $43 million and $200 million, respectively, 
from H3C. These amounts were accounted for as a return on investment and reflected as a reduction in the carrying 
balance of the Company's Investments in equity interests in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company also has commercial arrangements with H3C to buy and sell HPE branded servers, storage 
and networking products and services. For fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, HPE recorded approximately $256 million, 
$383 million and $848 million of sales to H3C and $72 million, $125 million and $148 million of purchases from H3C, 
respectively. Payables due to H3C as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $7 million and $10 million, 
respectively. Receivables due from H3C as of October 31, 2024  and 2023 were approximately $7 million and 
$12 million, respectively.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer 
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our 
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the 
end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer 
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes in our internal control over financial 
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during 
our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal

Exchange Act Section 13(r) Disclosure 
On March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Russian Federal Security Service (“FSB”) as a 
party subject to the provisions of U.S. Executive Order No. 13382 issued in 2005 (“Executive Order 13382”). On the 
same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) updated General 
License 1B (“General License 1B”) which generally authorizes U.S. companies to engage in certain licensing, 
permitting, certification, notification, and related transactions with the FSB as may be required for the importation, 
distribution, or use of information technology products in the Russian Federation. Our local Russian subsidiary 
(“HPE Russia”) may be required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and to file documents. There are 
no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by HPE with the FSB and all such 
dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B. We plan to continue these activities as required to support 
our orderly and managed wind down of our Russia operations.
On April 15, 2021, the U.S. Government issued an executive order on Blocking Property with Respect to 
Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation (“Executive Order 14024”), 
148

implementing additional U.S. sanctions against the Russian government and against Russian actors that threaten 
U.S. interests, including certain technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Service. The U.S. 
Secretary of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (“Positive Technologies”) under Executive Order 
14024 and Executive Order 13382. HPE Russia had dealings with Positive Technologies prior to its designation. 
Following the sanctions designation, HPE Russia immediately initiated procedures to terminate its relationship with 
Positive Technologies. HPE does not plan to engage in any further transactions with this entity, except wind down 
activities that are authorized by OFAC going forward. HPE Russia continues to have blocked property associated 
with Positive Technologies. No action will be taken unless and until a license is received from OFAC authorizing 
collection of the property. There are no identifiable gross revenues or net profits associated with HPE’s activities 
related to Positive Technologies for this reporting period.

PART III
ITEM 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.
The names of the executive officers of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and their ages, titles and biographies as of 
the date hereof are incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1, above.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has adopted insider trading policies and procedures applicable to our directors, 
officers, and employees, that we believe are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, 
rules, and regulations, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Our insider trading policy, among 
other things, (i) prohibits our employees and related persons and entities from trading in securities of Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise and certain other companies while in possession of material, non-public information, (ii) 
prohibits our employees from disclosing material, non-public information of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or another 
publicly traded company, to others who may trade on the basis of that information, and (iii) requires that certain 
designated individuals and roles of the Company only transact in Hewlett Packard Enterprise securities during an 
open window period, subject to limited exceptions. A copy of our insider trading policy is filed as Exhibit 19 to this 
Form 10-K. 
The following information will be included in Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Proxy Statement related to its 2025 
Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed within 120 days after Hewlett Packard Enterprise's fiscal year end of 
October 31, 2024 (the “Proxy Statement”) and is incorporated herein by reference:
• Information regarding (i) directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, including those who are standing for 
reelection and any persons nominated to become directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and (ii) any family 
relationships between any director, executive officer, or person nominated to become a director or executive 
officer, is set forth under “Our Board—Board Leadership Structure” and/or “Proposals to be Voted On—
